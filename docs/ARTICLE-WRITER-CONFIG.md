# DiggingScriptures — Article Writer Config
# Version: 1.0 | Created: 2026-02-24
#
# USAGE: Writer config for diggingscriptures.com.
# Load this when generating content for this site.
# Note: This site has 5 distinct content types, each with its own schema and purpose.

---

# 1. SITE IDENTITY

**Site:** diggingscriptures.com
**Voice:** Scholarly explorer — rigorous, accessible, respectful of all faith traditions
**Audience:** Historically curious travelers, pilgrimage planners, people interested in the
intersection of faith, history, and place. NOT primarily devotional — this is for people
who want to understand, not just believe.
**Revenue model:** Affiliate tours (Viator/GYG) — ONLY in designated sections of places/routes
**Content directory:** `src/content/{hubs,stories,places,routes,context}/`
**File format:** Markdown (.md) with YAML frontmatter (schemas enforced by Astro collections)
**URL patterns:**
- Hubs: `/{hub-slug}/`
- Places: `/places/{place-slug}/`
- Routes: `/routes/{route-slug}/`
- Stories: `/stories/{story-slug}/`
- Context: `/context/{context-slug}/`

# 2. CONTENT ARCHITECTURE

## Hub/Spoke Model
```
Hubs (authority pages — define topics)
  ↕
Places (sacred sites and destinations)
  ↔
Routes (pilgrimage paths connecting places)
  ↔
Stories (people, traditions, cultural narratives)
  ↔
Context (historical and cultural background)
```

Every place, route, story, and context page links UP to its parent hub.
Hubs link DOWN to all their children. Cross-links between types are encouraged.

## Current Content (mostly placeholder — being built out)
- Hubs: 2 (christian-pilgrimage-traditions, faith-based-journeys)
- Stories: 1 (placeholder)
- Places: 3 (placeholders)
- Routes: 1 (placeholder)

# 4. WRITING RULES

## Voice and tone
- **Scholarly but accessible.** Write like a well-read historian giving a walking
  tour, not like a textbook. Show the evidence, name the sources, but keep the
  narrative compelling.
- **Respectful of all faith traditions.** This site covers Christianity, Judaism,
  Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and indigenous practices. Treat all traditions with
  equal scholarly rigor and respect. Never frame one tradition as "correct."
- **Evidence-based.** Distinguish clearly between documented history and
  tradition/legend. "According to tradition, James preached in Iberia" not
  "James preached in Iberia" (when historical evidence is thin).
- **Hedge appropriately.** Use "tradition holds that," "scholarship suggests,"
  "archaeological evidence indicates" — calibrate confidence to evidence quality.
- **Sensory where relevant.** When describing places and routes, include what
  a visitor would see, hear, and feel. The physical reality of pilgrimage matters.
- **No devotional language.** This is not a worship site. Avoid "blessed,"
  "sacred duty," "spiritual awakening" as editorial voice. It's fine to quote
  or describe others using such language.

## Content-type-specific rules

### Hubs
- Cover the topic comprehensively — this is the definitive page on the subject
- Link to every related place, route, story, and context page
- Structured as: overview → historical development → modern practice → related content
- NO affiliate content. These are pure authority pages.

### Places
- Open with the physical reality of the place — what it looks like, where it is
- Layer historical context chronologically
- If `hasExperienceSection: true`, include a final section "Experiencing [Place] Today"
  with practical visitor info. Affiliate links ONLY go in this section.
- If `hasExperienceSection: false`, keep it purely historical/cultural.

### Routes
- Open with the route's significance and basic stats (distance, duration, difficulty)
- Describe the path — key waypoints, terrain, what pilgrims experience
- Historical context: who walked it, when, why
- If `hasModernSection: true`, include "Modern Pilgrimage Experiences" with
  practical info. Affiliate links ONLY here.

### Stories
- Center on the human narrative — a person, a tradition, a legend
- Clearly distinguish documented history from legend/tradition
- Connect to specific places and routes where possible
- NO affiliate content. Ever.

### Context
- Pure background/reference material
- Can be more academic in tone than other types
- Must still be readable by a non-specialist
- NO affiliate content. Ever.

## Data density requirements
- ≥3 specific dates or time periods per article
- ≥3 named historical figures or scholars
- ≥2 named primary sources (books, inscriptions, archaeological evidence)
- At least 1 "the evidence suggests" or "scholarship indicates" hedge per article
- Places/routes: ≥3 practical details (distance, elevation, climate, best season)

## Banned phrases
- journey (as metaphor — fine for literal pilgrimage journeys)
- unlock, game-changer, delve, realm, dive in
- furthermore, in conclusion, it's important to note
- sacred duty, spiritual awakening, blessed (as editorial voice)
- "the Holy Land" without qualification (specify whose holy land)

# 6. INTERNAL LINKING RULES

- **Every spoke links UP to its parentHub** (places, routes, stories, context)
