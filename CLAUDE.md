## Layout Slot Patterns

### Places: `<Fragment slot="history|culture|features|experience|related">`
### Routes: `<Fragment slot="history|journey|places|modern|related">`
### Stories: `<Fragment slot="narrative|context|legacy|related">`
### Context: default `<slot />` + `<slot name="concepts">` + `<slot name="sources">` + `<slot name="related">`
### Hubs: default `<slot />` (no fragments — plain markdown)

## Writing Rules (Key Points)
- Scholarly but accessible — like a historian giving a walking tour
- Respectful of ALL traditions equally — never frame one as "correct"
- Evidence-based: "tradition holds," "scholarship suggests," "archaeological evidence indicates"
- ≥3 dates, ≥3 named figures, ≥2 primary sources per article
- NO devotional language as editorial voice
- Banned: journey (as metaphor), unlock, game-changer, delve, realm, dive in, furthermore, in conclusion

## Key Files
- `docs/ARTICLE-WRITER-CONFIG.md` — Full 375-line writer config
- `CONTENT-MAP.md` — Complete content architecture
- `src/content/config.ts` — Astro collection schemas (LOCKED)
- `src/layouts/` — 7 layout templates (LOCKED)
- `netlify.toml` — Deployment config

## Pipeline (TODO)
- `digging-pipe.py` — Multi-threaded optimizer (not yet built)
- Should validate frontmatter, word counts, H2 counts, internal links, banned words
- Same pattern as protrainer-pipe.py and semantic-pipe.py
