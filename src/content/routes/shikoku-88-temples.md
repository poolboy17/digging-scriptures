<Fragment slot="history">

The Shikoku Pilgrimage, known in Japanese as the Shikoku Henro, traces a circuit of eighty-eight temples around the coastline and through the mountain interior of Shikoku, the smallest of Japan's four main islands. The pilgrimage is associated with Kūkai (774–835 CE), the founder of Shingon Buddhism in Japan, who was born on Shikoku and is believed to have practiced ascetic disciplines at many of the sites that became pilgrimage temples. Kūkai, known posthumously as Kōbō Daishi, remains the pilgrimage's spiritual patron, and pilgrims traditionally walk in his spiritual company — a concept expressed in the phrase dōgyō ninin, "two traveling together."

The historical development of the pilgrimage from scattered sites of ascetic practice to a formalized circuit of eighty-eight temples occurred gradually over several centuries. References to religious practitioners traveling among sacred sites on Shikoku appear as early as the twelfth century, but the standardization of the route with its specific number of temples and established sequence seems to date from the seventeenth century, when guidebooks for the pilgrimage began to appear in print. The number eighty-eight carries multiple symbolic associations in Buddhism, including the eighty-eight worldly desires (bonnō) that the pilgrimage is said to help overcome.

Each of the eighty-eight temples belongs to one of several Buddhist schools, though the pilgrimage itself is associated primarily with the Shingon tradition founded by Kūkai. The temples are grouped into four sections corresponding to Shikoku's four prefectures, each section associated with a stage of spiritual development: awakening (hosshin) in Tokushima, ascetic training (shugyō) in Kōchi, enlightenment (bodai) in Ehime, and nirvana (nehan) in Kagawa. This fourfold structure gives the circular route a progressive spiritual narrative, even as the physical path returns the pilgrim to approximately where they began.

The Edo period (1603–1868) saw the Shikoku Pilgrimage develop into a popular devotional practice accessible to ordinary people, not only to monks and ascetics. The cultural institution of settai — the offering of food, drink, shelter, or small gifts to passing pilgrims by local residents — became firmly established during this period and continues today. Settai reflects the Buddhist understanding that supporting pilgrims generates merit for the giver, creating a reciprocal economy of spiritual benefit that sustains the pilgrimage infrastructure through community generosity.

The pilgrimage's association with Kōbō Daishi extends beyond historical connection to a living spiritual reality for many participants. The traditional white jacket (hakui) worn by pilgrims bears the characters dōgyō ninin, and the walking staff (kongō-zue) is treated as a representation of Kōbō Daishi himself — it is ritually washed at the end of each day, stood upright rather than laid on the ground, and never used to point or gesture. These practices express the belief that the pilgrimage is not merely a commemoration of Kōbō Daishi's ancient journeys but a present-tense accompaniment by his enduring spiritual presence.

The traditional starting point is Temple 1 (Ryōzen-ji) in Tokushima Prefecture, though pilgrims may begin at any temple and need not walk the circuit in numerical order. The full circuit of approximately 1,200 kilometers typically requires forty to sixty days on foot, passing through coastal lowlands, mountain forests, agricultural valleys, and urban areas. The terrain varies from flat coastal paths to strenuous mountain ascents, with several temples located at significant elevation.

The Tokushima section (Temples 1–23) introduces the pilgrim to the practice through relatively accessible terrain along the eastern coast and inland valleys. The temples in this section tend to be closely spaced, allowing new walkers to adjust to the physical demands gradually. The alternates between farming communities, fishing villages, and forested hillsides that give early intimation of the mountain walking to come.

The Kōchi section (Temples 24–39), associated with ascetic training, presents the pilgrimage's most physically demanding stretches. The rugged southern coast of Shikoku offers spectacular scenery — rocky headlands, crashing surf, dense subtropical vegetation — but the distances between temples are significantly greater than in other sections. Several stretches require walking thirty or more kilometers between services, and the isolation can test a pilgrim's determination. Cape Muroto and Cape Ashizuri, two dramatic headlands, mark turning points both geographical and psychological.

The Ehime section (Temples 40–65), associated with enlightenment, moves through the island's western s. The terrain softens somewhat, and the spacing between temples becomes more manageable. This section includes several mountain temples requiring steep ascents, as well as the pilgrimage's passage through Matsuyama, Shikoku's largest city. The contrast between urban walking and mountain temple approaches highlights the pilgrimage's integration of the sacred and the everyday.

The Kagawa section (Temples 66–88), associated with nirvana, brings the pilgrim back to the northeastern corner of Shikoku. The completion of the circuit at Temple 88 (Ōkubo-ji) marks the formal end of the pilgrimage, though tradition holds that the journey is truly complete only after the pilgrim visits Mount Kōya in Wakayama Prefecture on the main island of Honshū to pay respects at Kūkai's mausoleum in the Oku-no-in cemetery. This final visit closes the circle by connecting the pilgrimage's end to its spiritual source.

The daily rhythm of the walking pilgrim follows a pattern: rise early, walk to the next temple, perform devotions (recitation of the Heart Sutra, offerings of incense and candles, collection of the temple's calligraphic stamp), then walk to the following temple or to accommodation. The repetition of this cycle — walking, arriving, praying, walking — creates a meditative structure that accumulates over weeks into a sustained practice of movement and attention.

**Temple 1 — Ryōzen-ji** (Tokushima) serves as the traditional starting point. Pilgrims purchase their equipment here — white jacket, conical straw hat, walking staff, stamp book — and receive instruction on the rituals performed at each temple. The temple's precincts include a shop providing everything needed for the journey, making it a site of practical as well as spiritual preparation.

**Temple 24 — Hotsumisaki-ji** (Kōchi), perched on Cape Muroto at the southeastern tip of Shikoku, marks the transition into the pilgrimage's most challenging section. The temple was founded, according to tradition, by Kūkai during a period of intense meditation in a nearby sea cave. The approach involves a long walk along the coast followed by a climb to the headland, and the location offers panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean that reward the effort of arrival.

**Temple 45 — Iwaya-ji** (Ehime) occupies a cliff face that ranks among the pilgrimage's most dramatic settings. The temple's halls are built against and into the rock, with wooden structures extending from natural caves. The approach involves climbing ladders and narrow paths along the cliff, creating a physical experience that echoes the rock-cut monasteries found in Buddhist traditions across Asia.

**Temple 75 — Zentsū-ji** (Kagawa) holds particular significance as Kūkai's birthplace. The temple complex is one of the largest on the pilgrimage circuit, and its association with the founder of Shingon Buddhism gives it a status that extends beyond the pilgrimage to the broader Japanese Buddhist world. The temple's hall of ancestors preserves paintings depicting episodes from Kūkai's life.

**Mount Kōya** (Wakayama Prefecture, Honshū), while not among the eighty-eight temples, serves as the pilgrimage's spiritual conclusion. The Oku-no-in cemetery, containing over 200,000 memorial markers shaded by ancient cedar trees, leads to Kūkai's mausoleum, where tradition holds that the master rests in eternal meditation. The journey to Mount Kōya after completing the circuit closes the narrative loop, returning the pilgrim to the spiritual presence that accompanied them throughout.

The Shikoku Pilgrimage has experienced a significant revival since the late twentieth century, driven partly by a broader Japanese cultural interest in spiritual tourism and partly by international attention following publications and documentaries about the route. Annual pilgrim numbers are estimated between 100,000 and 200,000, though only a fraction complete the full circuit on foot. Many Japanese pilgrims travel by car or tour bus, visiting the temples without the walking component, a practice that the pilgrim community views with varying degrees of acceptance.

International participation has grown substantially, particularly since English-language guidebooks and online resources became available. The pilgrimage now attracts walkers from across Europe, North America, and Australia, many of whom have no Buddhist affiliation but are drawn by the challenge of a long-distance walk, the cultural immersion it provides, or the spiritual dimension of a journey structured around contemplative practice. The growing international presence has prompted some temples and accommodation providers to offer English-language services.

Accommodation along the route includes temple lodgings (shukubō), where pilgrims sleep in tatami rooms and may participate in morning prayers; minshuku (family-run guesthouses); business hotels in urban areas; and a network of free or donation-based pilgrim huts (tsūya-dō). The settai tradition continues, with local residents offering food, drinks, or small gifts to passing pilgrims. These encounters between walkers and the communities they pass through remain one of the pilgrimage's most valued features.

The stamp book (nōkyō-chō), in which each temple's calligrapher inscribes the temple name and stamps it with vermillion seals, serves as both credential and art object. A completed book, with its eighty-eight pages of brush calligraphy, becomes a family heirloom and, traditionally, accompanies its owner to the grave. The collection of stamps provides a tangible record of progress that structures the pilgrim's relationship with the journey and creates a lasting physical artifact of the experience.

Unlike the Camino de Santiago, the Shikoku Pilgrimage has no central administrative body coordinating its development. The temples operate independently, local governments promote their sections with varying degrees of enthusiasm, and the pilgrim community self-organizes through informal networks and online forums. This decentralized character gives the Shikoku Henro a quality of organic authenticity that many pilgrims find appealing, even as it means that infrastructure quality and waymarking consistency vary along the route.
