<Fragment slot="history">

The Umrah is the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca, distinguished from the Hajj by its scope, timing, and obligation. While the Hajj is one of Islam's five pillars — required once in a lifetime of every Muslim with the means and health to perform it — the Umrah is a voluntary act of devotion that can be performed at any time of year. The Prophet Muhammad performed Umrah multiple times, and the hadith literature records his encouragement of the practice: "Umrah to Umrah is an expiation for the sins committed between them."

The rituals of Umrah are a subset of the Hajj rituals. Both begin with entering the state of ihram — the condition of ritual purity marked by specific clothing, behavioral restrictions, and the declaration of intention (niyyah). Both include Tawaf, the sevenfold circumambulation of the Kaaba, and Sa'i, the walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa. But the Umrah omits the Hajj's defining rites: the standing at Arafat, the overnight stay at Muzdalifah, the stoning at Mina, and the animal sacrifice. Where the Hajj unfolds over five or six days across multiple sites in the greater Mecca area, the Umrah can be completed in a few hours.

The historical development of the Umrah as a distinct practice reflects the evolving needs of the Muslim community. In the early centuries of Islam, when travel to Mecca was dangerous and expensive, most Muslims could aspire to the Hajj only once — if at all. The Umrah offered an alternative: a shorter, less demanding pilgrimage that could be performed outside the specific Hajj dates (the eighth through thirteenth of Dhul Hijjah) and that carried spiritual reward without the full logistical burden. As travel became easier, the Umrah grew in popularity, and it is now performed by millions of Muslims annually, far outnumbering the Hajj pilgrims.

The Saudi government has progressively expanded Umrah access. The introduction of dedicated Umrah visas, the expansion of the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) to accommodate over two million worshippers, and the development of transportation and hospitality infrastructure in Mecca have transformed the Umrah from an occasional devotional act into a year-round pilgrimage industry. During Ramadan, when the spiritual rewards of Umrah are understood to be multiplied, the Grand Mosque reaches its maximum capacity.

The Umrah begins before the pilgrim reaches Mecca. Travelers enter the state of ihram at designated boundary points called miqat — stations on the major routes approaching the city. Each miqat corresponds to a historical direction of approach: Dhul Hulayfah for pilgrims from Medina, al-Juhfah for those from the direction of Syria and Egypt, Qarn al-Manazil for those from the Najd, Yalamlam for those from Yemen, and Dhat Irq for those from Iraq. Pilgrims arriving by air typically enter ihram before or during the flight, as the airplane crosses the miqat boundary.

Entering ihram involves a ritual washing (ghusl), the donning of ihram garments — two unstitched white cloths for men; regular modest clothing for women, with face and hands uncovered — and the recitation of the Talbiyah: "Labbayka Allahumma labbayk" (Here I am, O God, here I am). From this point, the pilgrim observes a set of restrictions: no perfume, no cutting of hair or nails, no sexual relations, no hunting. These restrictions create a condition of simplicity that mirrors the state in which the pilgrim will stand before God.

Upon reaching the Grand Mosque, the pilgrim performs Tawaf — seven counterclockwise circuits around the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure at the mosque's center that Muslims regard as the house of God built by Ibrahim and his son Ismail. The circuits begin and end at the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad), set into the Kaaba's eastern corner. Kissing or touching the Black Stone is recommended but, given the density of crowds, most pilgrims simply gesture toward it as they pass. During Tawaf, pilgrims recite prayers and supplications, many walking in a state of intense emotional engagement — weeping, whispering, or silent.

After Tawaf, the pilgrim performs two cycles of prayer (raka'at) behind the Maqam Ibrahim (Station of Abraham), a glass enclosure containing a stone said to bear Ibrahim's footprint. The pilgrim then drinks from the water of Zamzam — the spring that, according to tradition, God caused to flow for Hagar and Ismail — before proceeding to Sa'i.

Sa'i consists of walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa, which are now enclosed within the Grand Mosque complex in a long, air-conditioned gallery. The walk commemorates Hagar's desperate search for water for her infant son in the desert, running between the two hillocks looking for help. The distance between Safa and Marwa is approximately 450 meters, so the seven traversals total roughly 3.15 kilometers.

The Umrah concludes with the halq or taqsir — shaving or trimming the hair — which marks the pilgrim's exit from the state of ihram. Men typically shave the head completely (halq) or trim it short (taqsir); women cut a small portion of their hair. With this act, the restrictions of ihram are lifted, and the Umrah is complete.

The Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) is the physical setting for the entire Umrah. It is the largest mosque in the world, with a current capacity exceeding two million worshippers after recent expansions. The Kaaba stands at its center in a large open courtyard (the Mataf), surrounded by the multi-story prayer halls and galleries that have expanded outward in concentric rings over the past century.

The Kaaba is a cube of approximately 13 meters in height, draped in the kiswah — a black silk cloth embroidered with Quranic verses in gold thread that is replaced annually. The structure is understood not as a dwelling for God but as a focal point for worship — the qibla toward which all Muslims pray. Its simplicity is theological: the building's power derives not from architectural grandeur but from its role in the Abrahamic narrative and its designation as the axis of Islamic devotion.

The Zamzam well, located within the Grand Mosque complex, provides water that pilgrims drink during and after Tawaf. The well is approximately 30 meters deep, and despite millions of annual drinkers, it has never run dry — a fact that Muslim tradition attributes to divine provision. The water is distributed through coolers and fountains throughout the mosque, and pilgrims often carry bottles home as blessed gifts.

The Safa-Marwa gallery, where Sa'i is performed, has been fully enclosed and air-conditioned since the 1950s. The two-level corridor includes a central lane reserved for pilgrims in wheelchairs or with mobility limitations. Green fluorescent markers along the route indicate the section where men are encouraged to walk briskly, recalling Hagar's urgency.

The modern Umrah experience has been shaped by Saudi Arabia's massive investment in infrastructure and by the digital systems that now manage pilgrim flow. Visa applications are processed electronically through the Nusuk platform, and pilgrims can book Umrah permits, accommodation, and transportation through a single digital interface. Within the Grand Mosque, crowd management systems use real-time monitoring to direct pilgrims to less congested areas.

The expansion of the Masjid al-Haram — ongoing since the 1950s and dramatically accelerated in recent decades — has transformed the physical experience of Umrah. The current structure includes multiple levels for Tawaf, escalators, retractable domes for ventilation, and air conditioning throughout. These improvements have made the Umrah physically accessible to a much wider range of pilgrims, including the elderly and those with limited mobility.

Accommodation in Mecca ranges from luxury hotels with direct views of the Kaaba to budget pilgrim housing in the surrounding neighborhoods. The Abraj al-Bait towers, immediately adjacent to the mosque, constitute one of the largest hotel complexes in the world. Transportation within the city includes a metro system connecting key pilgrimage sites.

Ramadan is the peak season for Umrah. The Prophet Muhammad stated that performing Umrah during Ramadan is equivalent in reward to performing the Hajj, and millions of Muslims time their visit accordingly. The last ten nights of Ramadan, when the Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr) is believed to fall, see the Grand Mosque at maximum capacity, with continuous worship through the night.
