Mount Kailash, rising 6,638 meters above the Tibetan Plateau in the remote Ngari Prefecture of western Tibet, occupies a position unique in world religion: it is considered sacred by four distinct faith traditions simultaneously. Hindus regard it as the abode of Shiva, where the god sits in eternal meditation with his consort Parvati. Buddhists associate it with the Buddha Demchok (Chakrasamvara), a tantric deity representing supreme bliss. Jains venerate it as Ashtapada, the site where their first tirthankara, Rishabhadeva, attained spiritual liberation. Followers of Bön, Tibet's pre-Buddhist shamanic tradition, consider it the seat of all spiritual power and the place where their founder Tonpa Shenrab descended from heaven.

No mountain on earth carries such a density of sacred meaning across so many traditions. This convergence is not coincidental — it reflects Mount Kailash's position at the hydrological and geographical heart of Asia. Four of the continent's great rivers — the Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra, and Karnali (a tributary of the Ganges) — originate near its base, a geographical fact that ancient cosmographers interpreted as evidence of divine design. The mountain's distinctive symmetrical peak, its four faces aligned roughly with the cardinal directions, and its isolation from other peaks of comparable size all contributed to its identification as the axis mundi — the center and pillar of the world.

The practice of circumambulating Mount Kailash — known as kora in Tibetan, parikrama in Sanskrit — represents one of the oldest continuously performed pilgrimage rituals on earth. Hindu texts dating to the early centuries of the Common Era describe the circumambulation, and the practice likely predates these written records by centuries. The act of walking around the mountain, keeping it always to one's right (for Hindus and Buddhists; Bön practitioners and Jains walk counterclockwise), transforms the pilgrim's body into an instrument of devotion, tracing a circle that mirrors the cosmic cycles of creation, existence, and dissolution.

Tibetan Buddhist tradition holds that a single kora erases the sins of one lifetime, while 108 circuits guarantee enlightenment. The most devoted practitioners perform the kora by full-body prostration — lying face down, marking the spot reached by the fingertips, standing, walking to that mark, and prostrating again — a method that extends the three-day walk to two or three weeks and demands extraordinary physical endurance and spiritual commitment.

The political history of the region has alternately facilitated and restricted access to Mount Kailash. The incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China in 1950 and the subsequent Cultural Revolution severely disrupted pilgrimage traditions. Since the 1980s, limited access has been restored, though the journey remains subject to permit requirements, seasonal restrictions, and periodic political closures that can cancel planned pilgrimages with little warning.





The kora circuit of approximately 52 kilometers typically requires three days for walkers, though exceptionally fit pilgrims may complete it in a single long day and prostrating pilgrims may take two to three weeks. The route reaches its highest point at the Drolma La pass (5,636 meters), one of the highest points regularly crossed by pilgrims anywhere in the world. The altitude alone makes this among the most physically demanding pilgrimage routes in existence, and adequate acclimatization is essential.

**Day 1** begins at the town of Darchen (4,575 meters), the base camp for the kora. The path heads west before turning north along the western face of the mountain, passing the Tarboche flagpole, where thousands of prayer flags are renewed annually during the Saga Dawa festival. The day's walk of approximately 20 kilometers follows the Lha Chu (River of the Gods) valley, gradually gaining elevation while providing increasingly dramatic views of Kailash's western and northern faces. The night is spent at Dirapuk Monastery (4,909 meters), positioned directly opposite the mountain's north face — a wall of ice and rock that rises over 1,700 meters above the monastery in a single vertical sweep.

**Day 2** constitutes the kora's physical and spiritual crux. The route climbs steeply from Dirapuk to the Drolma La pass, gaining over 700 meters of elevation across technically non-demanding but exhausting terrain at extreme altitude. The pass itself, festooned with prayer flags and marked by a large boulder known as the Drolma Rock, is considered the point of spiritual death and rebirth — pilgrims are said to leave their old karma at the pass and descend as renewed beings. The descent, steep and demanding on the knees, leads to Lake Gauri Kund, a small sacred lake that is often frozen, before reaching the overnight stop at Zutulpuk Monastery (4,790 meters).

**Day 3** is the shortest and least demanding, covering approximately 12 kilometers from Zutulpuk back to Darchen. The route follows the eastern valley of the Dzong Chu, passing through terrain that gradually opens from narrow gorge to broad valley floor. The return to Darchen completes the circle, and pilgrims often celebrate the completion with prostrations, prayers, and — in the case of Tibetan pilgrims — butter tea shared with fellow walkers.

The experience of the kora is shaped fundamentally by altitude and remoteness. At over 4,500 meters, every step requires more effort than at sea level, and the thin atmosphere produces shortness of breath, headaches, and fatigue even in fit walkers. This physical difficulty is understood within the pilgrim framework not as an obstacle but as a component of the practice — the body's struggle mirrors and facilitates the spiritual work of purification that the kora represents.





**Mount Kailash** itself, while never climbed (the Chinese government has maintained a ban on mountaineering attempts, and religious authorities from all four traditions oppose climbing), is the constant visual reference point of the kora. Its distinctive peak — resembling a jewel sitting on a lotus pedestal in Buddhist iconography, or the lingam of Shiva in Hindu interpretation — is visible from multiple points along the circuit and serves as the visual and spiritual anchor around which the pilgrim's journey revolves.

**Dirapuk Monastery**, on the kora's northern section, provides the most celebrated view of Kailash's north face. The monastery, rebuilt after destruction during the Cultural Revolution, serves as both a pilgrim shelter and an active place of worship. The view from its courtyard — the massive north face framed between valley walls — is considered one of the most sacred panoramas in Tibetan Buddhism.

**Drolma La Pass** (5,636 meters) represents the kora's spiritual apex. The pass is associated with the goddess Tara (Drolma in Tibetan), who is said to have guided the first pilgrims over this high and dangerous crossing. The accumulation of prayer flags, mani stones, and small offerings left by generations of pilgrims has created a of accumulated devotion that physically manifests the passage of countless seekers across this threshold.

**Lake Manasarovar**, located approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Mount Kailash, is often visited in conjunction with the kora. Hindu tradition identifies it as Mansarovara, created by the mind of Brahma, and bathing in its waters is considered an act of great spiritual merit. The lake, at 4,590 meters one of the highest freshwater bodies in the world, reflects Kailash on clear days, creating a mirror image that reinforces the mountain's axis mundi symbolism.

**Darchen**, the base town for the kora, has developed from a small settlement into a modest service center for pilgrims and tourists. Its facilities remain basic — guesthouses, small restaurants, supply shops — reflecting both the region's remoteness and the Chinese authorities' cautious approach to tourism development in politically sensitive Tibet.





Access to Mount Kailash requires permits obtained through a licensed travel agency, as independent travel in the Tibet Autonomous Region is not permitted for foreign visitors. Groups must be accompanied by a government-appointed guide and driver, and permits can be revoked or denied without explanation, particularly during politically sensitive periods. This administrative framework makes the Kailash pilgrimage one of the more difficult sacred journeys to plan with certainty.

The journey to Kailash from Lhasa takes approximately three to four days by road, crossing vast expanses of the Tibetan Plateau at altitudes consistently above 4,000 meters. An alternative route from Kathmandu, Nepal, via the Simikot or Hilsa border crossings, provides access from the south, though this route involves its own permit complexities and infrastructure challenges. The remoteness of the site is itself part of its sacred character — the effort required to reach Kailash functions as a preliminary purification.

Indian pilgrims access Kailash through the annual Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, organized by the Indian government's Ministry of External Affairs. Places on this government-organized pilgrimage are allocated by lottery, and the waiting list can extend for years. The route from India crosses the Himalayan passes of Lipulekh or Nathu La, and the journey's difficulty — high altitude, challenging terrain, basic facilities — requires medical fitness certification. The diplomatic dimension of the Yatra, involving coordination between the Indian and Chinese governments, adds a geopolitical layer to what is fundamentally a devotional practice.

Climate conditions restrict the kora season to approximately May through October, with June and September generally offering the best combination of accessible passes and manageable weather. The Saga Dawa festival (the full moon of the fourth Tibetan month, typically falling in May or June) is the most auspicious time for the kora and draws the largest numbers of Tibetan pilgrims. During Saga Dawa, the Tarboche prayer flagpole is ceremonially renewed, and the atmosphere around Kailash reaches its most festive and communal.

The environmental and cultural impact of increasing visitor numbers has raised concerns among both preservation advocates and religious authorities. The fragile high-altitude ecosystem recovers slowly from disturbance, and waste management at this altitude and remoteness presents significant challenges. Balancing access for pilgrims — for whom the kora holds profound spiritual significance — with protection of the that makes the experience meaningful represents an ongoing tension without easy resolution.
