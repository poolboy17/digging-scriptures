<Fragment slot="history">

Three times each year — at Pesach (Passover), Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Tabernacles) — the Jewish population of ancient Israel was commanded to appear before God at the Temple in Jerusalem. The Torah's instruction in Deuteronomy 16:16 is direct: "Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God at the place that he will choose." This commandment, known as aliyah leregel (ascending on foot), generated one of the ancient world's great pilgrimage systems, bringing hundreds of thousands of people into Jerusalem for festivals that combined sacrifice, celebration, and national solidarity.

The pilgrim's journey began well before reaching Jerusalem. Travelers from the Galilee, the coastal plain, the Transjordan, and eventually from diaspora communities in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Roman Mediterranean made their way along established routes. The Mishnah describes pilgrims traveling in organized groups, singing the Psalms of Ascent (Psalms 120-134) as they approached Jerusalem. These psalms, which progress from distress to joy and from exile to homecoming, functioned as a liturgical soundtrack for the journey, building anticipation with each step.

Approaching Jerusalem from the south — the most common route from the Hebron road — pilgrims would first catch sight of the Temple from the ridge of the Mount of Olives. The Talmud records that this view provoked tears, prayer, and tearing of garments among those seeing the Temple for the first time or returning after long absence. The emotional impact was architectural as well as theological: Herod's expansion of the Temple Mount had created a platform of extraordinary scale, and the Temple itself, faced with white stone and gold, was visible for miles.

The ascent to the Temple Mount followed a defined sequence. Pilgrims first immersed in one of the dozens of mikvaot (ritual baths) that archaeological excavation has uncovered south and west of the Temple Mount. These stepped pools, carved into the bedrock, accommodated large numbers of people simultaneously, reflecting the enormous volumes of pilgrims who needed to achieve ritual purity before entering the sacred precincts. The recently excavated Pilgrims' Road, a monumental stepped street running from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple Mount's southern gates, has revealed the actual pavement walked by pilgrims during the Second Temple period.

The Southern Steps — a broad, monumental staircase leading up to the Hulda Gates in the southern wall of the Temple Mount — formed the primary entrance for pilgrims. The steps were deliberately built with alternating narrow and wide treads, a design that forced pilgrims to slow their pace and ascend with deliberation rather than rushing. Through the Hulda Gates, pilgrims passed through underground tunnels that emerged onto the Temple Mount platform itself, stepping from darkness into the vast open court with the Temple rising before them.

The Temple pilgrimage was not merely a religious obligation but a defining expression of Jewish collective identity. The Mishnah's tractate Hagigah and the historical accounts of Josephus describe Jerusalem during the festivals as a city transformed. The population, normally around 60,000 during the late Second Temple period, swelled to several hundred thousand. Pilgrims camped in the surrounding hills, filled the city's guest rooms, and overflowed into nearby towns. The economic impact was enormous — the pilgrimage trade sustained Jerusalem's economy — but the social impact was greater. Jews from across the Mediterranean world, speaking different languages and following different local customs, gathered in a single place, reinforcing the sense of a people united by covenant and practice.

The sacrificial rituals performed at the Temple during each festival were specific and elaborate. At Pesach, every family group slaughtered a lamb in the Temple courtyard, an act of participatory worship that connected individual households to the national narrative of the Exodus. At Sukkot, priests performed the water libation ceremony — drawing water from the Pool of Siloam and pouring it on the altar — accompanied by celebrations that the Mishnah describes as so joyous that "whoever has not seen the joy of the water-drawing has never seen joy in his life." At Shavuot, pilgrims brought the first fruits of the harvest in elaborate processions, with the Mishnah providing a detailed choreography of the presentation before the priests.

The destruction of the Temple in 70 CE by Roman forces ended the pilgrimage system abruptly. The loss was not only of a building but of an entire way of being Jewish — the sacrificial system, the priestly liturgy, the festival gatherings, and the physical act of ascending to God's presence. Rabbinic Judaism, which emerged in the generations after the destruction, transformed the pilgrimage impulse into prayer, study, and memory. The synagogue service incorporated language from the Temple liturgy. The festival prayers included petitions for the restoration of the Temple. And the Western Wall — the surviving retaining wall of Herod's platform — became the focal point for the grief and longing that had no temple to absorb.

The archaeological recovery of the pilgrim route has added a material dimension to what was previously known only from texts. Walking the Southern Steps today, visitors tread the same stones that pilgrims walked two thousand years ago — one of the rare instances in Jerusalem where physical continuity with the ancient past is demonstrable rather than traditional.

**Stage 1 — Ritual Immersion.** Pilgrims began by immersing in one of the mikvaot clustered south and southwest of the Temple Mount. Over fifty ritual baths have been excavated in this area, ranging from simple stepped pools to large installations capable of serving hundreds of people. The immersion was required for anyone entering the Temple precincts and marked the transition from ordinary space to sacred territory.

**Stage 2 — The Pilgrims' Road.** From the Pool of Siloam in the Lower City, pilgrims walked north along a monumental stepped street approximately 600 meters long and 8 meters wide, paved with massive flagstones. This road, excavated between 2013 and 2020, passed through a commercial district where pilgrims could purchase animals for sacrifice and change their currency into the Tyrian shekels required for the Temple tax.

**Stage 3 — The Southern Steps.** The broad staircase at the southern wall of the Temple Mount, approximately 60 meters wide, accommodated massive crowds ascending and descending simultaneously. The alternating step widths — one narrow, one wide — created a deliberate rhythm that slowed the pace and lent solemnity to the approach.

**Stage 4 — The Hulda Gates and Tunnels.** Two sets of gates in the southern wall (the Double Gate and the Triple Gate) led into vaulted underground passages that ascended through the platform's substructure. Pilgrims entering used one gate and exiting used the other, creating a one-way flow. The Mishnah notes that anyone in mourning circled in the opposite direction, so that fellow pilgrims could identify and comfort them.

**Stage 5 — The Temple Courts.** Emerging onto the Temple Mount, pilgrims entered the Court of the Gentiles, the vast outer plaza that surrounded the inner sanctum. Successive courts — the Court of Women, the Court of Israel, the Court of the Priests — restricted access by gender and priestly status. The altar, where sacrifices were performed, stood in the Court of the Priests, visible to the assembled worshippers but accessible only to the priestly families.

The physical remains of the pilgrim route are among the most significant archaeological sites in Jerusalem. The Southern Steps, partially restored, are accessible to visitors at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park (Davidson Center) adjacent to the southern wall of the Temple Mount. The original Herodian pavement is visible, and visitors can sit on the same stones where first-century pilgrims rested.

The Pilgrims' Road, excavated beneath modern Silwan, is accessible through the City of David archaeological site. Visitors walk through the underground tunnel along the original stepped street, emerging near the Western Wall. The experience of walking the actual route — ascending from the Pool of Siloam through the ancient commercial district toward the Temple Mount — provides a physical connection to the pilgrimage that texts alone cannot convey.

The Western Wall plaza serves today as the closest approximation to the Temple pilgrimage. Jews gather at the wall for prayer throughout the year, with the largest assemblies occurring during the three pilgrimage festivals and at the annual Tisha B'Av commemoration of the Temple's destruction. The priestly blessing ceremony during Sukkot, when thousands of Kohanim (descendants of the priestly families) extend their hands over the assembled crowd, is the most direct ritual link to the Temple service that survives in contemporary practice.

The question of Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount itself remains one of the most sensitive issues in Israeli-Palestinian relations. The Israeli government maintains a policy prohibiting non-Muslim prayer on the platform, which is administered as a Muslim holy site by the Jordanian-appointed Waqf. Some Jewish groups advocate for the right to pray on the Mount, while others — including most Orthodox rabbinic authorities — prohibit Jewish entry to the platform entirely, arguing that in the absence of the Temple's purification rituals, no one can be certain of avoiding the most sacred areas where only the High Priest was permitted to tread.
