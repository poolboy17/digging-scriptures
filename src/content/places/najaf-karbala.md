<Fragment slot="history">

Najaf and Karbala are the two most sacred cities in Shia Islam, and their significance arises from events in the seventh century CE that defined the Sunni-Shia divide. Najaf is the burial place of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, the Prophet Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, whom Shia Muslims regard as the first rightful successor (imam) to the Prophet. Ali was assassinated in 661 CE while praying at the mosque in Kufa, and tradition holds that he was buried at what is now Najaf. The Imam Ali Shrine, with its golden dome and twin minarets, has grown around the burial site over fourteen centuries of continuous veneration.

Karbala, eighty kilometers to the north, is where Imam Hussein — Ali's son and Muhammad's grandson — was killed in 680 CE in a confrontation with the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I. Hussein had refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid, whom he regarded as an illegitimate ruler, and traveled from Medina to Iraq with a small group of family members and followers. They were intercepted on the plains of Karbala, besieged, denied water, and killed. Hussein's death, along with that of most of his male companions, became the foundational tragedy of Shia Islam — an event whose theological and emotional weight within the tradition is difficult to overstate.

The shrines at both cities have been destroyed, rebuilt, expanded, and adorned repeatedly over the centuries. The Abbasid caliphs, Buyid rulers, Safavid shahs, and Ottoman sultans all left their marks on the architecture. The most devastating attack came in 1802, when Wahhabi forces from the Arabian Peninsula sacked Karbala, damaging the shrine of Hussein and killing thousands. The shrine was rebuilt with Persian patronage, and the golden dome that now defines its silhouette dates from the Qajar period. Under Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime (1979–2003), the shrines were restricted, and the Shia population of southern Iraq faced severe repression. The fall of the regime in 2003 opened the cities to mass pilgrimage on a scale not seen for decades.

The relationship between Shia devotion and the events at Karbala is not merely historical — it is liturgical, emotional, and present-tense. The annual commemoration of Ashura, observed on the tenth of Muharram, reenacts the suffering and martyrdom of Hussein through processions, passion plays (ta'ziyeh), chest-beating (latmiyya), and public mourning. The rituals are intense and communal, involving millions of participants in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, and Shia communities worldwide. The grief expressed during Ashura is not performative nostalgia; practitioners understand themselves as mourning an ongoing injustice — the defeat of righteousness by tyranny — that transcends its historical moment.

The Arba'een pilgrimage, held forty days after Ashura, has become the world's largest annual gathering of people. Estimates vary, but in recent years between fifteen and twenty million pilgrims have walked from Najaf to Karbala — a distance of roughly eighty kilometers — over several days. The route is lined with mawakib, temporary stations run by volunteers who provide free food, water, tea, medical care, and places to rest. The logistical operation is almost entirely grassroots: families, neighborhoods, and organizations set up stations out of devotion, expecting no compensation.

The Arba'een walk is notable for its radical hospitality. Iraqi Sunnis, Christians, Yazidis, and even non-Muslim foreigners have been welcomed at mawakib along the route. The event's scale and its ethos of unconditional generosity have drawn attention from journalists, scholars, and international organizations, yet it remains relatively unknown outside the Islamic world — partly because foreign media access has been limited by security conditions in Iraq.

Najaf is also the seat of the Hawza, the most important center of Shia religious scholarship. Grand Ayatollahs based in Najaf exercise considerable spiritual and, at times, political authority across the global Shia community. The city's identity as a center of learning and jurisprudence complements its identity as a place of mourning and devotion, making it both an intellectual and an emotional capital for Shia Islam.

The Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf is one of the most architecturally distinguished buildings in the Islamic world. The current structure features a golden dome, twin gold-clad minarets, and an interior decorated with mirror work, tile mosaic, and inscriptions. The tomb itself is enclosed by a silver zarih (cage-like screen) that pilgrims touch, kiss, and press their foreheads against in devotion. The mosque complex surrounding the shrine includes prayer halls that accommodate thousands of worshippers simultaneously.

The Imam Hussein Shrine in Karbala mirrors Najaf's architectural grandeur with its own golden dome and minarets. Adjacent to it is the Shrine of Abbas, Hussein's half-brother, who was killed attempting to bring water to the besieged camp. Abbas is revered as a symbol of loyalty and sacrifice, and his shrine draws nearly as many visitors as Hussein's. The two shrines are connected by a pedestrian street that forms the spiritual and commercial heart of Karbala.

Wadi al-Salam (Valley of Peace), the cemetery adjacent to the Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf, is one of the largest cemeteries in the world, covering more than six square kilometers with an estimated five to six million burials. Shia Muslims from across the world seek burial near Imam Ali, and the cemetery has been in continuous use for over fourteen centuries. Its vast expanse of tombs, mausoleums, and catacomb-like underground chambers is a landscape of collective memory that embodies the Shia relationship with death, mourning, and hope for intercession.

Najaf and Karbala are located in southern Iraq, connected by a highway that takes approximately ninety minutes by car. Najaf has an international airport with direct flights from Iran, Bahrain, and other regional hubs, as well as charter flights from Pakistan and India during pilgrimage seasons. Baghdad International Airport, roughly 160 kilometers to the north, serves as the primary gateway for international visitors.

Security conditions have improved significantly since the height of sectarian violence in the mid-2000s, but visitors should monitor current advisories. Organized pilgrimage tours are the most common way for international Shia visitors to access the shrines, and tour operators coordinate logistics including visas, transportation, accommodation, and guided visits. Independent travel is possible but requires more planning.

The shrines are open to visitors of all faiths, though the primary audience is Shia Muslim pilgrims. Modest dress is required, and women must wear a full chador (a loose-fitting covering) within the shrine precincts. Photography regulations are enforced and may vary. The cities are most crowded during Ashura (the first ten days of Muharram) and the Arba'een period (approximately fifty days after the start of Muharram), when accommodation and transportation become extremely strained.

The climate is hot and arid, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 45°C. The most comfortable visiting months are November through March. During the Arba'een walk, pilgrims endure whatever conditions prevail, and the mawakib along the route provide shelter from sun and cold alike.
