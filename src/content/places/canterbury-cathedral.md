Canterbury Cathedral has been the center of English Christianity since Augustine of Canterbury established his mission here in 597 CE. But it was the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in the cathedral on December 29, 1170 — struck down by four knights who believed they were fulfilling the wishes of King Henry II — that transformed Canterbury into one of the greatest pilgrimage destinations in medieval Europe.

Within three years of his death, Becket was canonized. Within a decade, his shrine in the cathedral's Trinity Chapel had become one of the wealthiest in Christendom, rivaling Santiago de Compostela and Rome. Pilgrims came from across Europe seeking healing and forgiveness. The stained glass "Miracle Windows" in the Trinity Chapel — dating to the 1180s and among the finest surviving medieval glass in the world — depict the miraculous cures attributed to Becket's intercession.

## The Pilgrims' Way

The traditional route from London to Canterbury follows what is now called the Pilgrims' Way — roughly 100 kilometers through Kent via Rochester. Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, written in the 1380s-90s, immortalized the social world of this pilgrimage: the knight, the prioress, the pardoner, the wife of Bath, each telling stories to pass the time on the road.

The modern **North Downs Way** and the revived **Pilgrims' Way** walking route follow much of the historic path. The walk takes 4-5 days and passes through the chalk hills and villages of Kent. Unlike the Camino's albergue system, accommodation is in pubs, B&Bs, and village inns.

## The Cathedral Today

Canterbury Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (jointly with St. Augustine's Abbey and St. Martin's Church). The Gothic nave, completed in the fourteenth century, leads to the site of Becket's martyrdom — marked by a simple altar and candle known as the Martyrdom. The original shrine was destroyed during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. The king ordered Becket's bones scattered and his name erased from all records.

The **crypt** is the oldest surviving part of the building, dating to the eleventh century. The **Corona Chapel** at the east end once housed a relic of Becket's skull. The **Chapter House** and **Cloisters** are atmospheric spaces that have served the cathedral's Benedictine community for centuries.

Evensong (5:30pm most days) is the most atmospheric way to experience the cathedral as a living worship space. The choir sings in the quire beneath the soaring Gothic vaults, and the setting transforms from tourist site to sacred space.

**Visiting**: the cathedral charges admission (approximately £16 adults), though worship services are free. Open daily. Photography is permitted except during services. The cathedral city itself is compact and walkable, with medieval streets, Roman walls, and the ruins of St. Augustine's Abbey.
