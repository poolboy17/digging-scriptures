<Fragment slot="history">

The Cave of Machpelah in Hebron holds claims to being one of the oldest continuously venerated sacred sites in the world. The Book of Genesis (chapter 23) records Abraham's purchase of the cave and surrounding field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place for his wife Sarah—a real estate transaction that represents the first land acquisition in the biblical narrative and establishes Hebron's foundational significance in Jewish sacred geography. According to tradition, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah are all buried within the cave, making it the tomb of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Israelite people.

The massive stone enclosure visible today—walls rising twelve meters high, built of Herodian-era limestone blocks similar to those of the Western Wall in Jerusalem—dates to the reign of Herod the Great (first century BCE). Herod's construction created a monumental frame around the cave entrance, establishing the architectural presence that has dominated the site for two millennia. The building's survival through successive conquests—Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman, British, Jordanian, and Israeli—testifies to the reverence in which all occupying powers held the patriarchal tombs.

The Crusaders converted the structure into a church in the twelfth century, and Saladin transformed it into a mosque after recapturing Hebron in 1188. The Mamluks prohibited non-Muslim access in 1267, a ban that persisted under Ottoman and Jordanian rule for seven centuries—Jews were permitted to approach no higher than the seventh step of the eastern staircase. Israel's capture of the West Bank in 1967 restored Jewish access to the interior for the first time since 1267.

The site's dual sacred identity creates one of the most tense shared religious spaces in the world. Following the 1994 massacre in which an Israeli settler killed twenty-nine Muslim worshippers, the building was physically divided: approximately two-thirds allocated for Muslim worship (the Ibrahim Mosque) and one-third for Jewish worship (the Synagogue of Machpelah). Israeli military checkpoints control access, and the atmosphere of security measures pervades the pilgrim experience.

For Jews, Hebron represents the oldest connection to the land of Israel—a purchase rather than a conquest, predating even the Exodus from Egypt. The cave's association with the patriarchs and matriarchs makes it second only to the Temple Mount in sanctity. Jewish visitors often describe the site as connecting them to the deepest layer of their collective history, the point where the narrative of the Jewish people begins.

For Muslims, the site is the Ibrahimi Mosque, honoring Ibrahim (Abraham) as a prophet of Islam and the patriarch of monotheism. The Islamic tradition of venerating Abraham's tomb is ancient—the Quran describes Ibrahim as a hanif, a monotheist who submitted to God before the formal revelation of Islam—and Muslim worship at the site preceded the Crusader period by centuries. The cenotaphs within the building, covered with embroidered cloths, mark the traditional positions of the tombs below.

The political context of modern Hebron—a Palestinian city of over 200,000 with a small but heavily protected Israeli settler community in the Old City—makes pilgrimage to the Cave of the Patriarchs inseparable from the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Visitors from both communities describe their experience in terms that combine spiritual devotion with political assertion, and the site functions simultaneously as a place of worship and a symbol of competing claims to the land.

The Herodian enclosure measures approximately sixty by thirty-five meters, with walls constructed of dressed limestone blocks—some over seven meters long—fitted without mortar in the same technique used at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. The quality of the stonework and the scale of the construction reflect Herod's characteristic ambition and suggest the importance he attached to the patriarchal site.

The interior contains six cenotaphs arranged in pairs, traditionally identified with Abraham and Sarah (in the central hall), Isaac and Rebecca (in the southern chamber), and Jacob and Leah (in the northern chamber, visible through a narrow window). The actual cave system lies beneath the building and is not accessible to visitors. Limited archaeological investigations in 1967 and 1981 revealed a narrow passage leading to a chamber containing human remains, pottery, and artifacts dating to various periods, but comprehensive excavation has never been permitted due to the site's religious sensitivity.

The architectural layers visible within the building trace the site's religious history. Herodian walls form the outer shell. Crusader-era columns and capitals survive in the interior. Islamic additions include the minbar (pulpit) donated by Saladin, one of the finest examples of Ayyubid woodwork extant—carved cedarwood assembled without nails or glue. The mihrab (prayer niche) orients Muslim worshippers toward Mecca. Jewish additions since 1967 include Torah arks and menorot in the sections allocated for Jewish worship.

Visiting the Cave of the Patriarchs requires navigating Israeli military checkpoints, and access protocols differ for Jewish and Muslim visitors. The site is located in the H2 zone of Hebron, under Israeli security control. Visitors should be prepared for security screening and should carry identification. The political sensitivity of the location means that conditions can change rapidly, and checking current access arrangements before visiting is advisable.

Ten days per year, the entire building is opened exclusively for Jewish worship (corresponding to Jewish holidays), and ten days for Muslim worship (corresponding to Islamic holidays). On all other days, the divided arrangement applies. Jewish visitors access their section through the eastern entrance; Muslim visitors through the western entrance, which also serves as the mosque's main portal.

The site is accessible from Jerusalem (approximately forty-five minutes by car) or from other West Bank cities. Organized tours from Jerusalem are available through various operators, some explicitly political in orientation—visitors should be aware of the perspective being presented. Independent visits are possible but require familiarity with the checkpoint system and the divided geography of Hebron's Old City.

The Old City of Hebron, surrounding the Cave, contains a traditional market (souk) and historic architecture that testifies to the city's long commercial importance. However, much of the Old City center has been affected by the security arrangements related to the nearby Israeli settlement of Beit Hadassah, and the atmosphere differs markedly from typical Middle Eastern market towns.
