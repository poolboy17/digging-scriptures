Fatima is one of the most important Marian pilgrimage sites in the Catholic world, drawing an estimated six million visitors annually to a small town in central Portugal. The site's significance stems from a series of apparitions in 1917, when three shepherd children — Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto — reported that the Virgin Mary appeared to them six times between May and October.

The apparitions occurred during World War I and carried messages of prayer, penance, and peace. The final apparition on October 13, 1917, was accompanied by what an estimated 70,000 witnesses described as the "Miracle of the Sun" — the sun appearing to dance, spin, and plunge toward the earth. The event was reported in secular newspapers and remains one of the most widely witnessed alleged miraculous phenomena in modern history.

## The Sanctuary

The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima is centered on the **Cova da Iria**, the field where the apparitions occurred. The vast esplanade — larger than St. Peter's Square in Rome — can accommodate up to 300,000 pilgrims and is flanked by two basilicas.

The **Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary** (completed 1953) is a neo-baroque church containing the tombs of all three visionaries. Francisco and Jacinta were canonized by Pope Francis in 2017 — the youngest non-martyred saints in Catholic history. Lúcia became a Carmelite nun and died in 2005; her cause for canonization is underway.

The **Basilica of the Most Holy Trinity** (completed 2007), designed by Greek architect Alexandros Tombazis, is a massive modern structure seating 9,000. Its spare, circular interior reflects post-Vatican II liturgical aesthetics.

The **Chapel of the Apparitions** marks the exact location where Mary is believed to have appeared. It is the spiritual heart of the site — a small open-air chapel beneath a glass canopy, with a statue of Our Lady of Fatima at the spot where the children reported seeing the Virgin. Mass is celebrated here throughout the day.

## The Three Secrets

The messages reportedly given by Mary to the children — known as the Three Secrets of Fatima — have become central to modern Catholic devotion. The first two secrets, revealed by Lúcia in the 1940s, described a vision of hell and predicted the end of World War I, the rise of Russia, and a second world war. The third secret, kept sealed until 2000, described a vision of a "bishop in white" being shot — widely interpreted as referring to the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.

## Pilgrimage Practice

The most distinctive pilgrimage practice at Fatima is **walking on the knees** across the esplanade to the Chapel of the Apparitions. Thousands of pilgrims make this journey — typically 200-300 meters on a polished stone path — as an act of penance, thanksgiving, or petition. The practice is physically painful and emotionally intense.

The **candlelight procession** each evening at 9:30pm, when tens of thousands of pilgrims process across the esplanade carrying candles and singing the Ave Maria, is one of the most visually powerful rituals in Catholic pilgrimage.

The major pilgrimage dates are May 13 and October 13 (anniversaries of the first and last apparitions). The May celebration regularly draws 500,000 or more pilgrims.

**Getting there**: Fatima is 130 kilometers north of Lisbon, accessible by bus (90 minutes from Lisbon's Sete Rios terminal) or car. Accommodation ranges from pilgrim hostels to hotels surrounding the sanctuary.
