<Fragment slot="history">

Mecca's sacred status predates Islam by centuries. The city occupied a strategic position along Arabian trade routes connecting Yemen to the Levant, and the Kaaba—a cube-shaped structure at its center—served as a shrine housing idols venerated by various Arabian tribes. Islamic tradition traces the Kaaba's origins to Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail, who are understood to have built the original structure as a house of monotheistic worship.

The Prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 CE and received his first revelations there around 610 CE. His message of monotheism and social justice met resistance from the Quraysh, the tribe that controlled the city and profited from the pilgrimage trade. Muhammad's emigration to Medina in 622 CE (the Hijra) marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar, and his return to Mecca in 630 CE—achieved largely without bloodshed—established Muslim control over the city and its sacred precinct. Muhammad cleansed the Kaaba of its idols and rededicated it to the worship of the one God, transforming a polytheistic pilgrimage center into the focal point of Islamic monotheism.

Under the early caliphates, Mecca's religious infrastructure expanded. The Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties enlarged the Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) surrounding the Kaaba. The Ottoman Empire, which controlled Mecca from 1517 to 1916, undertook further renovations. The most dramatic transformations came under Saudi rule in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with massive expansion projects that increased the mosque's capacity from tens of thousands to over two million worshippers.

Mecca is unique among the world's sacred cities in one crucial respect: non-Muslims are prohibited from entering the city. This restriction, based on Quranic interpretation and enforced by Saudi law, means that Mecca exists as a space exclusively devoted to Muslim worship and pilgrimage. The boundary (haram) around the city is marked by checkpoints, and visitors must present documentation of their Muslim faith to proceed.

The experience of approaching Mecca has been described by pilgrims across centuries as overwhelming. The first sight of the Kaaba—usually upon entering the Masjid al-Haram through one of its many gates—produces a response that travelers from Ibn Battuta in the fourteenth century to Malcolm X in the twentieth have struggled to articulate. The physical encounter with a structure that has oriented every prayer and symbolized the unity of the Muslim community generates emotions that combine the personal and the communal in ways few other pilgrimages achieve.

The ihram state, entered before reaching Mecca's boundary, equalizes all pilgrims. Men don two white unsewn cloths; women wear modest clothing with faces uncovered. The physical uniformity erases visible markers of wealth and status, enacting a theology of equality before God. The talbiyah—a prayer chanted continuously during the approach—declares the pilgrim's response to God's call: "Here I am, O God, here I am."

The Zamzam well, located within the Masjid al-Haram compound, produces water that Muslims consider blessed. Tradition associates the spring with Hajar's search for water for her infant Ismail, when the angel Jibril caused water to emerge from the desert floor. The well has produced water continuously for over four thousand years according to tradition, and geological studies indicate it taps an aquifer that has sustained flow for at least as long as the historical record extends.

The Kaaba stands approximately thirteen meters high, with sides ranging from ten to twelve meters in length. Its walls are constructed of gray stone quarried from surrounding hills, though the structure has been rebuilt multiple times—most recently following a siege in 1979 and flood damage at various points in history. The kiswa, an embroidered black cloth covering the Kaaba, is replaced annually, with the old cloth cut into pieces and distributed as gifts. Gold-embroidered Quranic verses on the kiswa represent some of the finest textile artistry in the Islamic world.

The Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad), set into the Kaaba's eastern corner at a height of approximately 1.5 meters, is the object of particular veneration. Islamic tradition holds that Ibrahim placed the stone, which had been sent from paradise, in the corner of the Kaaba. The stone, now dark and fragmented (held together by a silver frame), is touched or kissed by pilgrims performing tawaf when crowds permit, though the Prophet Muhammad indicated that pointing toward it from a distance suffices.

The Maqam Ibrahim, a glass and metal enclosure near the Kaaba, contains a stone bearing what tradition identifies as Ibrahim's footprints, left when he stood on it while building the Kaaba. Pilgrims offer two units of prayer behind the Maqam after completing tawaf. The Masjid al-Haram itself has undergone continuous expansion, with the most recent Saudi-era projects creating a multi-story structure with air-conditioned prayer halls, escalators, and retractable sections that can accommodate over two million worshippers during the Hajj.

The hills of Safa and Marwa, between which pilgrims walk seven times during the sa'i ritual, are now enclosed within the mosque complex in a long gallery equipped with separate lanes for walking and for those using wheelchairs. The original rocky outcrops are preserved at each end, visible behind glass, connecting the modern ritual space to the ancient topography.

Access to Mecca requires a Hajj or Umrah visa issued by the Saudi government. Hajj visas are allocated through a quota system that assigns a specific number of permits to each country based on Muslim population. The application process involves registration through authorized agencies, and demand significantly exceeds available places. Umrah visas are more readily available and can be obtained throughout the year, though the Saudi e-visa system has simplified the process in recent years.

The physical demands of the Hajj are significant. Walking distances during the five days of rituals can exceed fifty kilometers in desert heat that regularly exceeds forty degrees Celsius during summer months. The Saudi authorities have invested heavily in infrastructure—air-conditioned tents at Mina, the Jamarat Bridge redesign completed in 2006 to improve crowd flow, and extensive medical facilities—but pilgrims should be prepared for physical challenge. Elderly and infirm pilgrims may perform certain rituals by proxy.

Accommodation in Mecca ranges from luxury hotels in the towers surrounding the Masjid al-Haram to more modest options in outlying neighborhoods. The clock tower complex, completed in 2012, includes the world's third-tallest building and provides thousands of hotel rooms within walking distance of the mosque. During Hajj season, tent camps at Mina house pilgrims according to national groupings, with varying standards of comfort.

Transportation within the holy sites has been improved by the Haramain High Speed Railway connecting Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah, and by the Makkah Metro (Mashair Railway) serving the ritual sites. Most pilgrims arrive via King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, which operates special Hajj terminals during peak season.
