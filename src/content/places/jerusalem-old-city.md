<Fragment slot="history">

The Old City of Jerusalem occupies less than one square kilometer, yet within these ancient walls lies ground sacred to three major world religions. For Christians, Jerusalem holds the sites associated with the final days, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, making it the original and supreme pilgrimage destination of the faith.

The city's sacred status predates Christianity. As the location of Solomon's Temple and the center of ancient Israelite worship, Jerusalem was already a pilgrimage city when Jesus traveled there for festivals described in the gospels. The destruction of the Second Temple by Roman forces in 70 CE transformed both the city and the religious traditions connected to it.

The Romans rebuilt Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina following the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132-135 CE, constructing pagan temples over Jewish and early Christian sacred sites. This period of suppression lasted until the conversion of Emperor Constantine in the early fourth century. Constantine's mother Helena traveled to Jerusalem around 326-328 CE, traditionally credited with identifying the sites of the crucifixion and burial of Christ beneath the Roman temple of Venus.

Constantine ordered the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre over these sites, creating the structure that remains the focal point of Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The original fourth-century building underwent destruction and reconstruction multiple times, most notably following its demolition by the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim in 1009. The current structure dates substantially from the Crusader period of the twelfth century, with subsequent modifications by various communities.

The city passed through many hands over subsequent centuries: Byzantine, Persian, Arab, Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman, British, Jordanian, and Israeli. Each period left its mark on the urban fabric and the conditions under which pilgrims could visit. The Crusades themselves represented a fusion of pilgrimage and military expedition, with armed pilgrims seeking to secure Christian access to the holy places.

The Old City is divided into four quarters: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Armenian. This division, formalized during the Ottoman period, reflects the complex religious geography of the city, though the boundaries have shifted over time and the quarters were never entirely homogeneous.

The Christian Quarter clusters around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, containing numerous churches, monasteries, and hospices built to serve pilgrims over the centuries. The Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Apostolic, Coptic, Ethiopian, and Syriac Orthodox churches all maintain presence within or near the Holy Sepulchre, their rights and territories within the building governed by the Status Quo arrangement dating from the Ottoman period.

The Via Dolorosa, the path traditionally believed to trace Jesus's route from condemnation to crucifixion, winds through the Muslim Quarter before reaching the Holy Sepulchre. This processional way developed over centuries, with stations marking events described in the gospels and Christian tradition. The current route dates from the eighteenth century, though earlier pilgrims followed different paths reflecting different understandings of the city's sacred geography.

The Mount of Olives, across the Kidron Valley from the Old City, contains sites associated with Jesus's teaching, his agony in Gethsemane, and his ascension. Churches mark each of these locations, some dating to the Byzantine period or earlier. The mountain also contains ancient Jewish cemeteries, reflecting the belief that the resurrection of the dead will begin there.

Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem involves encounter not only with ancient sites but with living Christian communities who have maintained presence in the city through centuries of political change. These communities—Greek Orthodox, Latin Catholic, Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopian, and others—preserve distinct liturgical traditions and maintain the sacred sites. The pilgrim thus enters not an archaeological museum but a city where worship continues.

The presence of Judaism and Islam adds dimensions that complicate and enrich the experience of Christian pilgrimage. The Western Wall, the remnant of the Second Temple's retaining wall and the holiest site in Judaism, lies adjacent to the Christian and Muslim Quarters. The Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, contains the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, among the most significant sites in Islam. Pilgrims navigate this shared sacred geography, encountering other faiths not as abstractions but as living presences.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre remains the preeminent Christian pilgrimage site in Jerusalem. The building encompasses both Golgotha, the traditional site of the crucifixion, and the tomb where Jesus was buried and from which he rose. The current structure presents a complex architectural palimpsest, incorporating elements from the twelfth-century Crusader church along with later additions and modifications.

Upon entering, pilgrims encounter the Stone of Anointing, where tradition holds that Jesus's body was prepared for burial. This slab, dating from the nineteenth century, replaced earlier stones and is venerated by pilgrims who kneel to touch and kiss it. To the right, steep stairs ascend to Golgotha, where two chapels—one Greek Orthodox, one Roman Catholic—mark the site of the crucifixion. A glass panel reveals the rock of Calvary itself.

The Rotunda dominates the western portion of the church, its dome rising above the Edicule, the small structure enclosing the tomb of Christ. The Edicule was most recently restored in 2016-2017 after centuries of decay and previous reconstructions. Within it, pilgrims enter a small antechamber before passing into the burial chamber itself, where they may briefly touch the stone slab marking where Christ's body lay.

The church contains numerous other chapels, altars, and sacred sites maintained by the various Christian communities. The Chapel of Adam, beneath Golgotha, preserves a rock fissure traditionally interpreted as evidence of the earthquake at the moment of Christ's death. The Chapel of Saint Helena, reached by descending stairs from the ambulatory, occupies a former cistern where Helena is said to have discovered the True Cross.

The Via Dolorosa's fourteen stations wind through the streets of the Old City, beginning near the Lions' Gate where the Antonia Fortress once stood. The first stations commemorate Jesus's condemnation by Pilate and his taking up of the cross. Subsequent stations mark falls along the way, encounters with his mother and with Veronica, and the assistance of Simon of Cyrene. The final five stations lie within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself.

The Garden of Gethsemane, at the foot of the Mount of Olives, preserves ancient olive trees—some possibly dating to the time of Christ—and the Church of All Nations, built in 1924 over Byzantine and Crusader predecessors. The rock where Jesus prayed on the night of his arrest lies before the altar. The garden provides a contemplative space removed from the intensity of the Holy Sepulchre.

Visiting Jerusalem requires navigating practical realities that have varied significantly across different periods. The city's political situation affects ease of access, visa requirements, and the experience of moving between areas. Travelers benefit from understanding the current arrangements before planning their visit.

The Old City is compact enough to explore on foot, though its hilly terrain and crowded streets can be physically demanding. The area within the walls contains few accommodations; most visitors stay in hotels in West or East Jerusalem and enter through one of the several gates. The Jaffa Gate, Damascus Gate, and Lions' Gate are the most commonly used entrances.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre opens early, and many pilgrims find the morning hours, before tour groups arrive, offer a more contemplative atmosphere. The church is managed jointly by multiple Christian denominations, and visitors may witness liturgies in Greek, Latin, Armenian, Coptic, or other languages depending on the time and day. Modest dress is expected.

Organized pilgrimage groups traveling with religious leaders can often arrange for masses or services at specific sites. Independent travelers may join public liturgies or simply visit the sites for private prayer and reflection. The experience differs significantly depending on whether one travels as part of a structured pilgrimage or independently.

Some travelers engage local guides who specialize in Christian pilgrimage sites, providing historical context and assisting with navigation. Such guided experiences exist across a range of options, from brief walking tours to extended programs lasting several days. Certain pilgrimage organizations coordinate group travel with spiritual direction and shared liturgical experiences throughout the journey.

The heat of summer can make extended walking uncomfortable, and the major Christian festivals—Easter especially—bring intense crowds. The period following Easter and before summer, and again in autumn, often offers favorable conditions for visiting. The experience of the Easter liturgies themselves, particularly the Holy Fire ceremony on Holy Saturday in the Orthodox tradition, draws many despite the crowding.

Accommodations in Jerusalem range widely, from modest pilgrim hospices maintained by religious communities to international hotels. Some visitors specifically seek the experience of staying in a hospice or guesthouse with a religious character, while others prefer more conventional tourist accommodations. Options within the Christian Quarter tend toward the simpler end of the spectrum.
