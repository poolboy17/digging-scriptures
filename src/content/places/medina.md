Medina—originally known as Yathrib—entered Islamic history in 622 CE when the Prophet Muhammad and his followers emigrated there from Mecca, an event known as the Hijra that marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. The city's Arab and Jewish tribes had invited Muhammad to serve as an arbiter of disputes, and his arrival transformed Yathrib from a fractious oasis settlement into the political and spiritual capital of the nascent Muslim community. The city's name changed to Madinat an-Nabi, "City of the Prophet," shortened to al-Madina, "the City."

Muhammad's first act upon arrival was to establish a mosque, initially a simple structure of palm trunks and mud brick with a courtyard open to the sky. This building, al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque), served simultaneously as a place of worship, a community center, a court of law, and eventually the Prophet's residence. When Muhammad died in 632 CE, he was buried in the room of his wife Aisha, adjacent to the mosque—a decision that permanently fused the mosque with the Prophet's tomb and established Medina's enduring sacred status.

The first four caliphs—Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali—governed the expanding Islamic empire from Medina, though Ali later moved the capital to Kufa. Abu Bakr and Umar were buried alongside Muhammad in Aisha's chamber, creating a site of triple veneration. The Umayyad dynasty's transfer of the capital to Damascus in 661 CE diminished Medina's political importance but did nothing to reduce its spiritual significance. The city remained a center of Islamic scholarship, with the great legal traditions of Imam Malik ibn Anas developing there in the eighth century.




Visiting Medina, while not a formal requirement of the Hajj, is strongly encouraged in Islamic tradition and nearly universally undertaken by pilgrims traveling to Mecca. The Prophet Muhammad himself said, "Whoever visits my grave, my intercession becomes guaranteed for him," though the authenticity of this hadith is debated among scholars. The practice of visiting the Prophet's Mosque and offering salutations at his tomb constitutes one of the most emotionally significant acts of Muslim devotion.

The Prophet's Mosque occupies a unique position in Islamic sacred geography. It is one of three mosques to which the Prophet specifically encouraged travel—the others being the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Prayer in the Prophet's Mosque is understood to carry a thousand times the reward of prayer elsewhere (excepting Mecca), a hadith that incentivizes worship there beyond the visit to the tomb itself.

The Rawdah—a section of the mosque between the Prophet's tomb and his pulpit (minbar)—is considered one of the gardens of Paradise, based on a hadith in which Muhammad described it as such. This relatively small area, marked by green carpet distinguishing it from the red carpet of the surrounding mosque, draws intense devotion. Pilgrims seek to pray within the Rawdah, though access is regulated due to crowding, with specific times allocated for men and women.

Jannatul Baqi, the ancient cemetery adjacent to the mosque, contains the graves of many of the Prophet's companions, family members, and early Islamic scholars. The site was substantially altered in 1925 when the Saudi authorities demolished the structures and domes that had marked the tombs, an action consistent with Wahhabi theology opposing the veneration of tombs but deeply controversial among other Muslim communities, particularly Shia Muslims who regard the buried figures as central to their tradition.





The Prophet's Mosque has undergone continuous expansion from its original humble dimensions to its current capacity of over one million worshippers. The most distinctive architectural feature is the Green Dome, rising above the chamber containing the tombs of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar. The dome, originally constructed in wood in 1279 CE and later rebuilt in stone, was painted green in 1837 during Ottoman renovations. It has become the most recognizable symbol of Medina.

The mosque's current form reflects a massive Saudi expansion completed in 1992 that increased the area tenfold. The expansion introduced retractable umbrellas over the courtyard—250 giant structures that open to shade worshippers during the day and close at night—creating one of the most visually distinctive features of modern Islamic architecture. Air conditioning, marble floors, and electronic systems manage the comfort of vast crowds.

Quba Mosque, located approximately three kilometers south of the Prophet's Mosque, holds the distinction of being the first mosque built in Islam. Muhammad laid its foundations upon arriving in the outskirts of Medina during the Hijra, before proceeding to the city center. The Prophet said that praying in Quba Mosque equals the reward of performing Umrah, and many visitors to Medina make the trip to pray there. The current structure, rebuilt and expanded several times, dates substantially from a 1986 renovation.

The Qiblatain Mosque marks the location where, according to tradition, Muhammad received the revelation directing Muslims to change their prayer direction (qibla) from Jerusalem to Mecca. This change, occurring approximately sixteen months after the Hijra, held both theological and political significance, establishing Mecca's primacy and distinguishing Islamic worship from Jewish practice. The mosque's name—"Mosque of the Two Qiblas"—commemorates this pivotal moment.

Mount Uhud, north of the city, is the site of the Battle of Uhud (625 CE), where the Muslim community suffered a painful defeat and the Prophet himself was wounded. The graves of the martyrs of Uhud, including Muhammad's uncle Hamza, remain a site of visitation. The mountain itself holds a place of affection in Islamic tradition; Muhammad described Uhud as "a mountain that loves us and that we love."





Unlike Mecca, Medina does not restrict entry to Muslims, though the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate surroundings are Muslim-only spaces. The city has developed extensive infrastructure for the millions of visitors who pass through annually, particularly during the Hajj season when most pilgrims visit Medina either before or after completing the pilgrimage rites in Mecca.

The Haramain High Speed Railway, operational since 2018, connects Medina to Mecca via Jeddah in approximately two and a half hours, transforming the logistics of combining visits to both holy cities. Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport serves direct flights from numerous international destinations during Hajj and Umrah seasons.

Accommodation clusters around the Prophet's Mosque, with options ranging from five-star hotels with mosque views to budget accommodations in surrounding neighborhoods. The Saudi government has undertaken extensive urban development in Medina, including the Dar al-Hijra development project that has modernized areas near the mosque while generating controversy over the demolition of historic structures.

The climate is hot and arid, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding forty degrees Celsius. The mosque's air conditioning and shaded courtyards provide relief, but walking between sites in summer requires precaution. The period from November through February offers the most comfortable conditions for extended exploration. Ramadan, regardless of season, brings particularly large numbers of visitors for evening prayers and the spiritual intensification of the fasting month.

Visitors typically spend two to four days in Medina. Beyond the Prophet's Mosque, Quba Mosque, and Qiblatain Mosque, sites of interest include the Seven Mosques complex commemorating the Battle of the Trench (627 CE) and the date palm farms that have characterized the Medina oasis for millennia.
