The Dome of the Rock was completed in 691-692 CE under the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, making it one of the oldest surviving works of Islamic architecture. The building stands on the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), known to Jews as the Temple Mount—the elevated platform in Jerusalem's Old City where the Jewish First and Second Temples once stood. The choice of location was deliberate: Abd al-Malik constructed his shrine over the Foundation Stone (as-Sakhra), a rock outcrop of profound significance to multiple traditions.

The Foundation Stone carries layered meanings. In Jewish tradition, it is the Even ha-Shetiyah, the foundation stone of creation and the site where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac (the Aqedah). In Islamic tradition, it is the point from which the Prophet Muhammad ascended through the heavens during the Isra and Mi'raj, the night journey described in the Quran's seventeenth surah. The stone thus anchors two distinct but interconnected sacred narratives within a single physical location.

Abd al-Malik's motivations have been debated by historians. Some scholars, following the tenth-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, suggest he sought to create a monument rivaling the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Others emphasize political motivations: asserting Umayyad legitimacy during a period when a rival caliph controlled Mecca. More recent scholarship suggests the building was conceived primarily as a commemorative shrine celebrating Islam's relationship to the Abrahamic tradition and Jerusalem's sacred geography.

The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and converted the Dome of the Rock into a church, the Templum Domini, adding an altar and a cross atop the dome. Saladin's reconquest in 1187 restored the building to Islamic use, and he commissioned extensive renovations including the removal of Christian additions and the restoration of Islamic inscriptions. The Mamluks and Ottomans maintained the structure, with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent undertaking a major renovation in the sixteenth century that included the ceramic tile exterior that largely survives today.





The Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount represents one of the most contested sacred spaces on earth. For Muslims, it is the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina. For Jews, it is the holiest place in the world—the site of the divine presence (Shekhinah) and the location toward which all prayers are directed. This dual claim, anchored in genuinely held religious convictions on both sides, makes the platform's governance an issue of extraordinary sensitivity.

Since 1967, when Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan, the site has operated under a complex arrangement: Israel maintains security control while the Islamic Waqf (religious endowment) administered by Jordan manages the religious sites. This Status Quo arrangement permits Muslim worship on the platform while restricting non-Muslim access to specific hours and prohibiting non-Muslim prayer—a policy that has generated ongoing controversy from multiple directions.

The Dome of the Rock is not a mosque but a shrine (mashhad) built to commemorate and protect the sacred rock. Al-Aqsa Mosque, the actual congregational mosque of the Haram al-Sharif, stands at the southern end of the platform. The distinction matters: Friday prayers and daily worship take place at al-Aqsa, while the Dome of the Rock serves primarily as a site of veneration and pilgrimage. However, many Muslims worship within the Dome of the Rock as well, and the entire platform is considered a single sacred precinct.

The building's golden dome—originally lead-covered, gilded in 1994 with eighty kilograms of gold donated by King Hussein of Jordan—has become the most recognizable feature of Jerusalem's skyline. Its visibility from across the city and the surrounding hills gives it a symbolic prominence that transcends its specific religious associations, functioning as a visual metonym for Jerusalem itself and, by extension, for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Dome of the Rock's octagonal plan, approximately twenty meters per side, supports a dome approximately twenty meters in diameter rising to a height of thirty-five meters above the platform. The design reflects late antique architectural traditions, drawing on Byzantine centrally planned buildings while creating something distinctly new. The double-ambulatory plan—two concentric walkways around the central rock—guides visitors in circumambulation, a practice that parallels the tawaf around the Kaaba.

The exterior is clad in ceramic tiles installed during Suleiman the Magnificent's renovation, replacing the original glass mosaic. The tiles, predominantly blue, green, and white with geometric and floral patterns, create a surface that shifts in appearance with changing light. The upper register bears Quranic inscriptions in gold on a blue ground, including passages from Surah Ya Sin and Surah al-Isra that reference the night journey and the unity of God.

The interior preserves the original seventh-century mosaic program—the oldest surviving large-scale Islamic mosaic decoration. The mosaics feature crowns, jewels, and vegetation on gold ground, with inscriptions that include the earliest known written Quranic passages. Notably, some inscriptions address Christians directly, affirming Jesus as a prophet while denying the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. Art historians consider these mosaics among the supreme achievements of early Islamic art.

The Foundation Stone itself rises approximately 1.5 meters above the floor, an irregular rocky outcrop approximately thirteen by eighteen meters. A small cave beneath the stone, known as the Well of Souls, is accessible by stairs. Islamic tradition associates various prophets with prayer at this site, and the cave holds particular devotional significance. A small reliquary once housed hairs from the Prophet Muhammad's beard, though these are no longer displayed.

Al-Aqsa Mosque, at the platform's southern end, provides the congregational worship space. The current structure dates substantially from the eleventh century, following earthquake damage, though it incorporates elements from earlier periods. The mosque can accommodate approximately five thousand worshippers and serves as the venue for Friday prayers attended by tens of thousands who fill the surrounding platform.





Non-Muslim visitors may access the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount through the Mughrabi Gate, located near the Western Wall plaza. Access is restricted to specific hours (typically Sunday through Thursday mornings), and these hours are subject to change based on security conditions and religious holidays. The site closes to non-Muslim visitors during Muslim prayer times and during periods of tension.

Non-Muslims are not currently permitted to enter the Dome of the Rock or al-Aqsa Mosque. Visitors may view the exteriors and walk the platform, which itself provides remarkable views of the Old City, the Mount of Olives, and the surrounding . Photography of the buildings' exteriors is generally permitted, though sensitivity to worshippers should guide behavior.

Security screening at the Mughrabi Gate can involve significant queues, particularly during tourist seasons. Modest dress is required, and items with religious symbols may draw scrutiny. Visitors should be aware that the site's political sensitivity means that access can be suspended without notice during periods of unrest or on politically significant dates.

The Western Wall plaza, directly below the platform's western retaining wall, provides the nearest accessible point for Jewish worship. The juxtaposition of the two sites—Jewish prayers at the wall below, Islamic worship on the platform above—visually encapsulates the overlapping sacred geographies that define Jerusalem. Many visitors to the Dome of the Rock combine the visit with the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, all within walking distance in the Old City. Our [3-day Jerusalem itinerary](/cities/jerusalem/3-days-in-jerusalem) sequences these sites to align with the Temple Mount's narrow access windows.
