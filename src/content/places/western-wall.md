The Western Wall (HaKotel HaMa'aravi) is a section of the ancient retaining wall built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE as part of his massive expansion of the Second Temple Mount platform. The wall itself was never part of the Temple proper but rather the infrastructure supporting the elevated esplanade on which the Temple stood. Following the Roman destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, this section of retaining wall survived because it served a structural rather than a sacred architectural function—the Romans destroyed the Temple building but left the platform walls largely intact.

The wall's transformation from structural remnant to Judaism's holiest site occurred gradually over centuries. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 CE), the Emperor Hadrian expelled Jews from Jerusalem, and access to the Temple Mount area was severely restricted. As Jews returned in limited numbers during later periods, they gathered at the nearest accessible point to where the Temple had stood—the western retaining wall—to mourn the destruction and pray for restoration.

By the Ottoman period (1517-1917), the section of wall used for Jewish prayer measured approximately twenty-eight meters in length, bordered by an alley less than four meters wide. This cramped space, in the shadow of buildings from the Mughrabi quarter, served as the primary venue for Jewish communal prayer at the site for four centuries. The wall acquired the name "Wailing Wall" among European observers, a reference to the visible grief of Jewish worshippers mourning the Temple's destruction—a term that Jews themselves generally consider inappropriate.

Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jordan controlled East Jerusalem, and Jews were denied access to the Western Wall for nineteen years. Israel's capture of the Old City in June 1967 restored Jewish access. Within days, the Israeli government demolished the Mughrabi quarter adjacent to the wall, creating the large prayer plaza that exists today and exposing additional courses of Herodian stonework that had been hidden behind buildings for centuries.





The Western Wall's sanctity derives not from the wall itself but from its proximity to the Temple Mount—specifically, to the site of the Holy of Holies (Kodesh HaKodashim), the innermost chamber of the Temple where the Ark of the Covenant was housed and where the divine presence was understood to dwell. Talmudic tradition states that "the Divine Presence (Shekhinah) has never departed from the Western Wall," a teaching that attributes ongoing sacred status to the site even in the Temple's absence.

The practice of inserting written prayers (kvitlach) into crevices between the wall's stones has become one of the most recognized features of Western Wall worship. The origins of this practice are unclear—some scholars trace it to the eighteenth century—but it has become so widespread that the notes are collected twice a year and buried on the Mount of Olives in accordance with the principle that written prayers and sacred texts should not be destroyed.

The wall plaza is divided into separate sections for men and women, a partition reflecting Orthodox Jewish law (halakha) regarding mixed-gender worship spaces. This arrangement has generated significant controversy, with Reform and Conservative Jewish movements advocating for egalitarian prayer space. A compromise section at Robinson's Arch, south of the main plaza, provides space for non-Orthodox worship, though disputes over its status and adequacy continue.

The Wall functions as both a national monument and a religious site, a dual identity that creates periodic tensions. Military swearing-in ceremonies, national memorial observances, and bar mitzvah celebrations take place alongside daily prayer services. The site's management by the Orthodox rabbinate, which governs dress codes and behavioral expectations, sometimes conflicts with the preferences of secular Israeli visitors and non-Orthodox Jewish pilgrims.

*Wailing Wall*


The visible portion of the Western Wall rises approximately nineteen meters above the prayer plaza, comprising twenty-eight courses of stone. Below the current ground level, an additional seventeen courses extend downward, the lowest dating to Herod's original construction. The Herodian stones are distinctive: massive, precisely cut limestone blocks with characteristic marginal drafting (raised flat borders around recessed centers), some weighing over five hundred metric tons. The largest single stone, visible in the Western Wall Tunnel, measures approximately thirteen meters in length and weighs an estimated 570 tons—one of the heaviest objects ever moved by human beings without modern machinery.

The Western Wall Tunnel, excavated along the full 488-meter length of the western retaining wall, provides access to sections not visible from the prayer plaza. The tunnel reveals architectural features including a Hasmonean-era water channel, a massive arch (Warren's Gate) that once provided direct access to the Temple Mount, and the enormous foundation stones that demonstrate the engineering ambition of Herod's project. Guided tours through the tunnel have become one of Jerusalem's most popular pilgrim and tourist experiences.

The prayer plaza accommodates several thousand worshippers simultaneously. The men's section, approximately twice the size of the women's section, features a covered area providing protection from sun and rain. Ark-like cabinets house Torah scrolls used for reading during prayer services. The atmosphere at the wall varies dramatically: contemplative during quiet weekday hours, exuberant during Shabbat evening services when crowds gather for singing and dancing, and solemn during days of national mourning.

Robinson's Arch, at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, preserves the spring of a monumental staircase that once ascended to the Temple platform. Archaeological excavations in this area have revealed the street that ran along the wall's base in the Second Temple period, complete with shops and drainage channels. The fallen stones from the Temple's destruction, still lying where they landed two thousand years ago, provide visceral evidence of the catastrophe that reshaped Judaism.





The Western Wall plaza is accessible at all hours, every day of the year, free of charge. Security screening is required upon entry. Visitors are expected to dress modestly—men must cover their heads (paper kippot are available at no charge near the entrance), and both men and women should cover shoulders and knees. The site is most crowded during Jewish holidays, particularly during the three pilgrim festivals (Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot) when priestly blessing ceremonies draw tens of thousands.

Shabbat (Friday evening through Saturday evening) transforms the Western Wall experience. The Friday evening Kabbalat Shabbat services attract large crowds, with multiple prayer groups forming across the plaza. The joyous atmosphere, with singing and dancing, contrasts with the contemplative weekday character. Visitors should note that photography and use of electronic devices are not permitted in the plaza area during Shabbat, in accordance with Orthodox Jewish law.

The Western Wall Tunnel tours require advance booking and typically last approximately seventy-five minutes. Tours are offered in multiple languages and provide archaeological and historical context that enriches understanding of the wall's significance. The tunnel exit emerges in the Muslim Quarter via a separate route from the entrance—an arrangement that occasionally generates friction during periods of political tension.

The Western Wall is located within the Old City, accessible through the Jaffa Gate or Dung Gate (the nearest entrance). Our [Jerusalem planning guide](/cities/jerusalem/planning-your-jerusalem-pilgrimage) covers dress codes, Shabbat schedules, and access details for all of the Old City's sacred sites. The surrounding Jewish Quarter, rebuilt after 1967, contains archaeological sites, synagogues, and the Cardo—a section of the Roman-era main street. Most visitors combine the Western Wall visit with the Old City's other major sites: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Dome of the Rock, all within walking distance.
