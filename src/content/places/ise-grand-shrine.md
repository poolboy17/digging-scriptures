Ise Grand Shrine is the most sacred site in Shinto — the spiritual home of the Japanese nation and the dwelling place of Amaterasu Ōmikami, the sun goddess from whom the Imperial family traces descent. The shrine complex occupies a forest of ancient Japanese cedars on the Isuzu River in Mie Prefecture, and its wooden buildings have been dismantled and perfectly reconstructed every twenty years for over 1,300 years.

The most recent rebuilding (shikinen sengū) took place in 2013. The next is scheduled for 2033. The practice, known as the式年遷宮 (shikinen sengū), ensures that the shrine is always new and always ancient — a physical embodiment of Shinto's theology of cyclical renewal. The cost of each rebuilding is approximately ¥55 billion ($370 million), funded by donations.

## The Two Shrines

The complex consists of two main shrines and 125 subsidiary shrines spread across the forest.

**Naikū** (Inner Shrine), formally Kōtai Jingū, is dedicated to Amaterasu. It is the holiest site in Shinto. The main sanctuary building — built in the ancient shinmei-zukuri style with an unpainted cypress-wood structure and thatched roof — sits behind four layers of wooden fences. Ordinary visitors can approach only as far as the second fence; the innermost area is accessible only to the Imperial family and chief priests. What you see is the top of the roof above the fence — and the power of the site comes from what you cannot see.

**Gekū** (Outer Shrine), formally Toyouke Daijingū, is dedicated to Toyouke Ōmikami, the goddess of agriculture, food, and industry. Convention holds that pilgrims visit Gekū first, then Naikū. The two shrines are 6 kilometers apart, connected by bus.

## Pilgrimage History

During the Edo period (1603-1868), pilgrimage to Ise became a mass phenomenon. Called **okage mairi**, these pilgrimages sometimes involved millions of people — in 1830, an estimated 5 million Japanese traveled to Ise in a single year, at a time when the total population was roughly 30 million. The pilgrimages were often spontaneous: entire communities would suddenly depart for Ise, crossing feudal boundaries that were normally strictly controlled.

The concept of **nuke mairi** (escape pilgrimage) allowed people — including women and servants who were not normally permitted to travel — to leave their homes for Ise without permission, using the pilgrimage as religious cover for freedom of movement.

## Visiting Today

The shrine receives approximately 8 million visitors annually. The approach to Naikū crosses the **Uji Bridge** over the Isuzu River, one of Japan's most photographed sacred structures. The bridge itself is rebuilt with each sengū cycle.

The **Oharai-machi** street leading to Naikū has been reconstructed to resemble an Edo-period pilgrimage town, with traditional shops, restaurants serving Ise udon (thick noodles in a simple broth), and stalls selling akafuku mochi — the local specialty sweet that has sustained Ise pilgrims since 1707.

**Etiquette**: the standard Shinto shrine protocols apply — bow before the torii gate, walk to the side of the path, purify at the temizuya fountain. Photography is prohibited near the main sanctuary buildings. The atmosphere is markedly quieter and more reverent than most tourist shrines. For detailed etiquette, see our [Japan etiquette guide](/cities/kyoto/etiquette-japan).

**Getting there**: Ise is 1.5 hours from Nagoya by Kintetsu Railway or 2 hours from Osaka. It can be incorporated into a broader [sacred Japan itinerary](/cities/kyoto/7-days-in-sacred-japan) or visited as a day trip from Osaka, Kyoto, or Nagoya.
