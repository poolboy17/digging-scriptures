<Fragment slot="history">

Lumbini preserves the site where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Maya Devi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama while traveling to her parents' home. The event is described in Pali and Sanskrit sources: Maya Devi paused in a garden at Lumbini, grasped the branch of a sal tree, and gave birth standing. The infant is said to have taken seven steps immediately, each step producing a lotus flower, and declared "I am the chief of the world."

The site's identification rests on archaeological evidence of unusual strength. The Emperor Ashoka visited Lumbini around 249 BCE and erected a sandstone pillar inscribed in Brahmi script: "Here the Buddha, the Sage of the Shakyas, was born." This inscription, rediscovered in 1896 by the German archaeologist Alois Anton Fuhrer and the Nepalese governor Khadga Shumsher Rana, provided definitive identification of the site after centuries of obscurity. The pillar remains standing, its inscription legible, constituting one of the most important archaeological documents in the history of religion.

Archaeological excavations have revealed layers of habitation predating Ashoka's visit. In 2013, a team from Durham University excavated beneath the Maya Devi Temple and discovered a timber structure dating to the sixth century BCE—the earliest archaeological evidence associated with the life of the Buddha. A central open space within the structure, free of roof supports and apparently never roofed, may represent the earliest known Buddhist shrine, possibly marking a sacred tree associated with the nativity narrative.

The site declined following the collapse of Buddhist patronage in India. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, visiting in the seventh century, found the monasteries deserted and the Ashoka pillar struck by lightning. Lumbini remained largely forgotten until its rediscovery in the late nineteenth century. Systematic development began in the 1970s under a UNESCO-backed master plan.

Lumbini occupies a distinctive position in Buddhist sacred geography as the only one of the four great sites located outside India (in Nepal). This geographical fact carries political significance: Nepal claims the Buddha as a Nepali figure, while Indian discourse often subsumes him within the broader Indian civilizational narrative. The tension surfaces periodically in diplomatic contexts and affects the framing of Lumbini's development and promotion.

The site's development follows a master plan designed by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange in 1978, commissioned by the United Nations. Tange's plan organizes the complex into three zones: a Sacred Garden containing the archaeological remains and the Ashoka Pillar, a Monastic Zone where Buddhist communities from around the world have constructed monasteries and temples, and a New Lumbini Village providing visitor services. The plan's implementation has been gradual, with some elements still incomplete.

The Monastic Zone creates a remarkable cross-cultural . Monasteries built by communities from Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, China, South Korea, Germany, France, Vietnam, Cambodia, and other countries line a central canal, each constructed in its national architectural style. A Theravada section and a Mahayana section face each other across the water, creating a physical representation of Buddhism's major divisions coexisting at the tradition's point of origin.

The Eternal Peace Flame, lit in 1986 and intended to burn continuously, symbolizes Lumbini's aspiration to serve as a center for world peace—an aspiration connected to the Buddha's teachings on non-violence and compassion. The flame burns near the Sacred Garden, connecting the historical nativity site to contemporary hopes for the tradition's continued relevance.

The Maya Devi Temple, a simple white structure built over the archaeological excavations, protects the Marker Stone—a sandstone slab identified as marking the precise birthplace. The stone was discovered during excavations in 1996, beneath layers of previous temple floors dating back to the third century BCE. Inside the temple, visitors can view the exposed archaeological layers through walkways and glass panels, observing brick structures from the Mauryan, Kushan, and Gupta periods stacked above the earliest timber shrine.

The Ashoka Pillar stands approximately seven meters tall (its upper portion having been broken, likely by lightning as Xuanzang reported). The inscription, carved in five lines of Brahmi script, records Ashoka's visit and his remission of taxes for Lumbini's residents in honor of the Buddha's birth. A protective enclosure surrounds the pillar, and access is controlled to prevent damage. The pillar's survival and legibility after more than 2,200 years makes it one of the most remarkable historical monuments in South Asia.

The Sacred Pond (Puskarni), located south of the Maya Devi Temple, is traditionally identified as the pool where Maya Devi bathed before giving birth and where the infant Siddhartha received his first bath. The brick-lined pool, surrounded by trees, provides a contemplative setting away from the temple's more structured pilgrimage environment. Archaeological evidence suggests the pool's construction dates to at least the third century BCE.

The Lumbini Museum, established in 2008, houses artifacts recovered from excavations at the site and surrounding area, including coins, pottery, sculptures, and inscriptions spanning from the Mauryan period to the medieval era. The collection, while modest compared to major national museums, provides essential context for understanding the site's development over two millennia.

Lumbini is located in the Terai lowlands of southern Nepal, approximately 290 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu. The nearest airport is Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa (Siddharthanagar), approximately twenty-two kilometers away, which handles domestic flights and limited international service. Overland travel from Kathmandu takes eight to ten hours by road; the journey from the Indian border at Sunauli-Belahiya takes approximately one hour.

The Sacred Garden is open daily. Entry requires a modest admission fee for foreign visitors. Shoes must be removed in the area around the Maya Devi Temple. Photography is generally permitted outside the temple but restricted within it. The site is most manageable in the morning before heat builds—the Terai lowlands are significantly hotter than Nepal's hill regions, with summer temperatures routinely exceeding thirty-five degrees Celsius.

The best visiting season is October through March, when temperatures are moderate and skies generally clear. The Buddha's birthday (Vesak/Buddha Jayanti), falling in April or May, draws the largest pilgrimage crowds and features special ceremonies. The monsoon season (June through September) brings heavy rain that can flood low-lying areas of the site.

Accommodation options include guest houses in Lumbini village, lodgings offered by some of the international monasteries, and hotels in nearby Bhairahawa. The infrastructure, while improving, remains basic compared to major tourist destinations. Many visitors combine Lumbini with other sites on the Buddhist Circuit in India—Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar—though crossing the Nepal-India border adds logistical complexity.
