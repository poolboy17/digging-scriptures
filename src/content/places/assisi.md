Assisi is the city of Francis — the twelfth-century son of a wealthy cloth merchant who renounced his inheritance, embraced radical poverty, and founded an order that would reshape Christianity. The town sits on the slopes of Monte Subasio in Umbria, its pink limestone buildings visible for miles across the valley below. Almost everything a pilgrim comes to see here connects to Francis, his companion Clare (founder of the Poor Clares), or the Franciscan tradition they created.

The city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized not just for its medieval architecture but for the spiritual significance of the Franciscan movement that originated here.

## The Basilica of San Francesco

The Basilica of San Francesco is Assisi's primary pilgrimage destination — and a paradox. Francis, who owned nothing and preached radical simplicity, is buried beneath one of the most lavishly decorated churches in Italy. The basilica was begun in 1228, two years after Francis's death, and consists of an Upper Church and a Lower Church, the latter containing his tomb in the crypt.

The **Upper Church** is famous for its Giotto frescoes — 28 scenes depicting the life of Francis, painted around 1300. These paintings are foundational works of Western art, marking a transition from Byzantine formality to the naturalism that would define the Renaissance. The cycle begins with Francis honoring a poor man and ends with his canonization.

The **Lower Church** is darker, more intimate, and more devotionally intense. Frescoes by Cimabue, Simone Martini, and Lorenzetti cover the walls and vaults. The atmosphere is medieval in the fullest sense — pilgrims have been descending these stairs to pray at Francis's tomb for nearly 800 years.

The **crypt**, rediscovered in 1818 after being sealed for security reasons, contains the stone sarcophagus with Francis's remains. The space is spare and modern, redesigned in the twentieth century to allow pilgrims to pass close to the tomb.

## Other Franciscan Sites

**San Damiano** — the small church outside the city walls where Francis heard the crucifix speak ("Francis, rebuild my church"). Clare and her community later lived here. The church remains largely unchanged.

**The Eremo delle Carceri** — a hermitage on the slopes of Monte Subasio where Francis retreated for prayer and fasting. The walk up from the city (4 kilometers) passes through oak forest and is itself a contemplative experience.

**The Porziuncola** — the tiny chapel inside the enormous Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli on the plain below Assisi. This is where Francis founded the Franciscan order and where he died on October 3, 1226. The basilica was built around the chapel to protect it, creating a surreal visual effect — a complete miniature church enclosed within a vast dome.

**The Basilica of Santa Chiara** — dedicated to Clare of Assisi. Her tomb is in the crypt. The church contains the crucifix that traditionally spoke to Francis at San Damiano.

## Visiting

Assisi is accessible as a day trip from [Rome](/cities/rome) (2.5 hours by train) or from Florence (2 hours). Staying overnight allows you to experience the town after the day-trippers leave, when the medieval streets empty and the evening light on Monte Subasio is extraordinary.

The **Via Francigena** passes through Assisi on some variant routes, connecting this Franciscan city to the broader tradition of Italian pilgrimage. See our [Via Francigena route page](/routes/via-francigena) and [Rome pilgrimage hub](/cities/rome).
