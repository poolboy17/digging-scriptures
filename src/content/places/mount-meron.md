<Fragment slot="history">

Mount Meron, the highest peak in Israel proper at 1,208 meters, has been a place of pilgrimage since at least the medieval period, centered on the tomb attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the second-century Talmudic sage whom tradition credits as the author of the Zohar, the central text of Jewish mysticism. Bar Yochai is said to have spent thirteen years hiding from Roman persecution in a cave on the mountain with his son Elazar, sustained by a miraculous carob tree and spring. During this period of concealment, according to Kabbalistic tradition, he received the mystical revelations that would be recorded in the Zohar.

The identification of the tomb on Mount Meron dates to at least the twelfth century, when Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveler from Navarre, recorded visiting it. By the sixteenth century, when Safed — the town at the base of Mount Meron — became the center of Kabbalistic revival under figures such as Isaac Luria and Moses Cordovero, the tomb had become a major pilgrimage destination. The proximity of bar Yochai's tomb to the Safed Kabbalists was not coincidental — these mystics understood themselves as working within and extending the tradition he had begun.

The tradition of the Lag BaOmer pilgrimage to Meron appears to have crystallized in the sixteenth century, drawing on several earlier strands. Lag BaOmer — the thirty-third day of the Omer count between Passover and Shavuot — is identified in Kabbalistic tradition as the anniversary of bar Yochai's death (his hillula, or spiritual wedding with the divine). According to the Zohar, bar Yochai revealed his deepest teachings on the day of his death, and a fire surrounded him as his soul departed. The Lag BaOmer bonfires that are lit at Meron and throughout the Jewish world commemorate this fire.

The pilgrimage grew steadily through the Ottoman period and expanded dramatically after the establishment of the State of Israel, which improved road access to the remote Galilee site. By the early twenty-first century, the annual gathering had grown to approximately half a million participants, making it the largest annual religious gathering in Israel. The 2021 stampede, which killed forty-five people in a crush at one of the narrow exits from the tomb compound, led to significant infrastructure changes and crowd-management reforms that have reshaped the logistics of the pilgrimage.

The Lag BaOmer pilgrimage to Meron is unlike any other event in Jewish life. It combines elements of Hasidic fervor, Kabbalistic ritual, communal celebration, and sheer physical endurance into an experience that participants describe in terms closer to ecstasy than to conventional worship. The central ritual is the hadlaka — the lighting of a massive bonfire on the roof of the tomb compound, traditionally ignited by a designated rabbi from one of the Hasidic dynasties. The flames, visible across the Galilee, are understood as a reenactment of the fire that accompanied bar Yochai's death and a means of connecting with the mystical light he revealed.

The custom of chalaka — bringing three-year-old boys to Meron for their first haircut — is one of the most widely observed practices at the site. In the tradition of upsherin, a boy's hair is left uncut until his third birthday, when it is ceremonially trimmed, leaving the peyot (sidelocks). Performing this ritual at bar Yochai's tomb is considered an auspicious beginning to the child's life of Torah study. Families travel from across Israel and the diaspora to observe this custom, and the sight of small boys receiving their first haircuts while surrounded by bonfires, music, and dense crowds is one of the defining images of the Meron pilgrimage.

Music and dance are central to the experience. Hasidic groups set up stages and sound systems throughout the mountain, and the singing and dancing continue throughout the night. The repertoire draws heavily on the mystical poetry of the Zohar and on Hasidic niggunim (wordless melodies) that are understood to elevate the soul and facilitate connection with the divine. The energy is cumulative — as the night deepens and the bonfires intensify, the singing grows louder and the dancing more ecstatic, reaching a peak around the hadlaka.

Beyond Lag BaOmer, Meron attracts visitors throughout the year. The tomb compound is open daily, and Jews of all backgrounds — Ashkenazi and Sephardi, Hasidic and non-Hasidic, religious and nominally secular — come to pray at bar Yochai's grave. The site functions as a place of personal petition: visitors recite psalms, light candles, and leave written requests at the tomb, asking for healing, fertility, livelihood, and spiritual guidance. The Kabbalistic association of bar Yochai with the revelation of hidden wisdom gives prayers at his tomb a particular intensity — the sense that one is approaching a figure who penetrated the deepest layers of reality.

The tomb compound consists of a stone building over the graves attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son Rabbi Elazar. The interior is divided into men's and women's prayer sections, with the cenotaphs accessible to worshippers through a partition. The walls are lined with bookshelves holding prayer books, Zohar volumes, and collections of psalms. Candles burn continuously, and the air carries the scent of wax and incense.

The roof of the tomb building serves as the platform for the Lag BaOmer bonfires. Following the 2021 reforms, the surrounding infrastructure has been significantly upgraded, with widened pathways, improved crowd-flow systems, and new lighting and safety installations. The approaches to the tomb, once narrow hillside paths that funneled hundreds of thousands of people through tight spaces, have been engineered to prevent the density conditions that led to the tragedy.

The broader Mount Meron area is a nature reserve of significant ecological value. The mountain supports Mediterranean oak and pine forests, and its summit area preserves remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered much of the Galilee. The Nahal Meron trail offers hikers a route through the forested slopes, passing seasonal streams and wildflower meadows. The juxtaposition of intense religious devotion at the tomb with the quiet beauty of the surrounding landscape is one of the distinctive qualities of a Meron visit.

Adjacent to the tomb compound, the ruins of an ancient synagogue have been partially excavated, dating to the late Roman or Byzantine period. The carved stone lintel, decorated with a wreath and eagles, suggests a community of some sophistication, and the synagogue's proximity to the tomb may indicate that the site was already a place of religious significance in antiquity, even before the specific identification with bar Yochai became established.

Mount Meron is located in the Upper Galilee, approximately thirty kilometers northwest of the Sea of Galilee. The nearest city is Safed (Tzfat), about ten kilometers to the east, which serves as the most convenient base for visitors. The site is accessible by car via Route 89, with parking available at the base of the mountain.

The tomb compound is open daily and admission is free. Regular visits outside the Lag BaOmer period are straightforward and uncrowded. Modest dress is expected — women should cover shoulders and knees, and men should wear a head covering. Prayer books and candles are available at the site.

The Lag BaOmer pilgrimage, typically falling in May, requires advance planning. Israeli authorities now manage crowd flow through a registration and ticketing system introduced after 2021. Transportation on Lag BaOmer is provided by dedicated bus services from major cities, as private vehicles are restricted from the mountain. Visitors should expect long walks from shuttle drop-off points, large crowds, loud music, and an atmosphere of intense celebration that continues through the night.

Safed itself warrants a visit. The hilltop city, with its blue-painted artists' quarter, ancient synagogues, and associations with the Kabbalistic masters of the sixteenth century, provides essential context for understanding why Meron became a pilgrimage destination. The Ari Synagogue, the Caro Synagogue, and the old cemetery where Isaac Luria and Joseph Caro are buried are all accessible on foot within the old city.
