The Camino de Santiago is the most walked pilgrimage route in the world. Over 400,000 people complete some version of the trail each year. That popularity means abundant infrastructure — a network of pilgrim hostels, well-marked trails, and a culture of mutual support that has evolved over a thousand years. It also means that practical decisions made before departure shape the experience dramatically. The route you choose, the month you walk, and the weight of your pack matter more than almost anything else.

This guide covers the planning decisions that experienced pilgrims wish someone had explained before their first Camino.

## Choosing Your Route

The [Camino de Santiago](/routes/camino-de-santiago) is not a single trail but a network of routes converging on [Santiago de Compostela](/places/santiago-de-compostela). The most popular options each offer a different experience.

The **Camino Francés** is the classic route — 800 kilometers from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on the French border to Santiago. It takes 30-35 days and crosses the Pyrenees, the Meseta plateau, and the green hills of Galicia. It has the best infrastructure, the most fellow pilgrims, and the most historical significance. The downside is crowds, especially in summer, when popular albergues fill by early afternoon.

The **Camino Portugués** runs 620 kilometers from Lisbon or 240 kilometers from Porto to Santiago. The shorter Porto variant is the second most popular route and takes 12-14 days. It passes through attractive Portuguese towns and crosses into Galicia for the final stretch. Less dramatic scenery than the Francés but also fewer crowds and a gentler gradient.

The **Camino del Norte** follows Spain's northern coast for 825 kilometers from Irún to Santiago. It is the most scenic route — coastal cliffs, Basque Country, Asturias — but also the most demanding, with significant daily elevation changes. Takes 32-35 days. Far fewer pilgrims than the Francés, which means more solitude but also fewer services.

The **Camino Primitivo** is the original route, following the path of the first documented pilgrimage in the ninth century. At 320 kilometers from Oviedo, it takes 12-14 days and crosses the rugged mountains of Asturias. It is the most physically challenging of the common routes and rewards with stunning mountain landscapes and the smallest crowds.

For first-time pilgrims with limited time, the **last 100 kilometers** of the Francés (from Sarria) meets the minimum distance requirement for the Compostela certificate and takes 5-7 days.

## The Credencial and the Compostela

The **credencial del peregrino** (pilgrim passport) is your essential document. It proves you walked the Camino and entitles you to stay in pilgrim-only albergues. Get it stamped at least once per day — at albergues, churches, bars, and tourist offices along the route. You can obtain a credencial from your local confraternity of Saint James before departure, or purchase one at the starting point of any route (Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, Sarria, Porto, etc.).

The **Compostela** is the certificate of completion, issued at the Pilgrim Office in Santiago. To receive it, you must have walked at least 100 kilometers (or cycled 200 kilometers) for religious or spiritual reasons, with credencial stamps proving each stage. If walking the last 100km from Sarria, you need two stamps per day for that section. The Pilgrim Office examines your credencial before issuing the Compostela — gaps in stamps mean rejection.

A **distance certificate** is also available for those walking for non-religious reasons, or who want documentation of a longer route.

## When to Walk

**May, June, and September** are the sweet spot — mild temperatures, long daylight, and manageable crowds. May offers wildflowers and green landscapes. September has the warmth of summer without the worst heat or crowds.

**July and August** are the busiest months. The Meseta section of the Francés becomes an exposed furnace with temperatures above 35°C. Albergues fill by noon. The social experience intensifies but so does competition for beds, showers, and restaurant seats.

**April and October** offer cooler weather and fewer pilgrims but bring rain, especially in Galicia. The Pyrenees crossing can still have snow in early April. Some mountain albergues close for the season.

**Winter walking** (November through March) is possible on the Francés and Portugués but many albergues close and services thin out. You will walk in rain and cold, sometimes alone for hours. The trade-off is profound solitude and an experience closer to what medieval pilgrims faced.

## Accommodation: The Albergue System

**Municipal albergues** are the backbone of the Camino. Run by local governments, they charge €6-12 per night for a bunk bed in a dormitory. They operate first-come, first-served (no reservations), open in the early afternoon, and enforce an early morning departure. You need a credencial to stay. Facilities are basic: bunk beds, shared bathrooms, sometimes a kitchen.

**Private albergues** cost €10-18 and often allow reservations. They tend to have smaller dorms, better facilities, and sometimes private rooms. Many serve meals.

**Hotels and pensions** are available in most towns along the Francés and Portugués for €30-80 per night. Useful as occasional rest stops or for pilgrims who prefer private rooms.

**Bed bugs** are an unfortunate reality of shared accommodation. Experienced pilgrims inspect mattresses before settling in, keep packs off beds, and carry a silk sleeping bag liner. If an albergue has a known problem, word travels fast among pilgrims on the trail.

## What to Pack

Pack weight is the single most important physical factor on the Camino. Your loaded pack should not exceed 10% of your body weight. Most experienced pilgrims carry 7-8 kilograms total, including water. Every unnecessary gram compounds over 800 kilometers into blisters, knee pain, and exhaustion.

**Essential gear**: broken-in trail shoes (not new ones), two sets of quick-dry clothing, rain jacket, sleeping bag liner, toiletries, first aid kit (blister supplies especially), headlamp, water bottle, credencial, phone and charger.

**Leave behind**: more than two changes of clothes, heavy books, "just in case" items, jeans, cotton anything. You can buy almost anything you forgot in towns along the way.

**Blister prevention** deserves special attention. Break in your shoes with at least 100 kilometers of practice walks before departure. Carry Compeed blister patches, not regular bandages. Apply them at the first sign of a hot spot, not after the blister forms. Wear synthetic or merino wool socks — never cotton. Some pilgrims apply petroleum jelly to blister-prone areas each morning.

## Budget

The Camino can be astonishingly affordable. A budget pilgrim spending €25-35 per day covers municipal albergues, supermarket food, and occasional café stops. The pilgrim menu (menú del peregrino) at restaurants along the route costs €10-14 for a three-course meal with wine.

A comfortable budget is €40-60 per day. This allows private albergue stays, restaurant meals, and the occasional hotel night for recovery.

The total cost for a 35-day Camino Francés runs €900-2,100 depending on accommodation and eating preferences, plus flights and pre/post-walk expenses.

Spain uses the euro. ATMs are available in most towns. Carry some cash — small villages may have limited card acceptance. Many albergues are cash-only.

## Training

The most common mistake first-time pilgrims make is undertaking insufficient training. The Camino is not a casual walk. Even the flattest sections demand 20-30 kilometers of daily walking with a loaded pack. Without preparation, the first week is misery.

Start training at least eight weeks before departure. Begin with 10-kilometer walks and increase distance weekly. By the final two weeks, complete at least three walks of 20+ kilometers carrying your loaded pack. Train on varied terrain — hills matter more than distance for Camino preparation.

The first three days are the hardest regardless of fitness level. Your body adjusts. By day five, most pilgrims find their rhythm. By day ten, 25 kilometers feels normal.

## Connecting to the Wider Pilgrimage

The Camino belongs to a broader [history of Christian pilgrimage](/context/history-of-christian-pilgrimage) that connects Santiago to [Rome](/cities/rome) and [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) as the three great medieval pilgrimage destinations. The [Legend of Saint James](/stories/legend-of-saint-james) that created the Camino draws on traditions that link the apostle to both Jerusalem and Iberia.

The Kumano Kodō in [Japan](/cities/kyoto) is the only other UNESCO-designated pilgrimage route. Completing both earns the Dual Pilgrim certificate. The two trails share a twinning arrangement that reflects their parallel status as living pilgrimage traditions with ancient roots and modern infrastructure.

The [psychology of pilgrimage](/context/psychology-of-pilgrimage) — why walking long distances changes people — is perhaps the Camino's deepest draw. Most pilgrims report that the internal journey overtakes the external one somewhere around the second week. The practical preparation in this guide exists to clear the path for that transformation. Get the logistics right and the Camino does the rest.
