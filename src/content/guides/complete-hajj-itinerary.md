The Hajj unfolds across five ritual days in the month of Dhul Hijjah, following a sequence established by the Prophet Muhammad during his farewell pilgrimage in 632 CE. Every Muslim who performs Hajj follows the same steps, in the same places, in the same order — a unity of practice that makes the Hajj the largest synchronized act of worship on earth.

This itinerary walks through each day in sequence, explaining what happens, where, and what the pilgrim should expect physically and spiritually. Read our [Hajj planning guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/planning-your-hajj-or-umrah) for visa logistics, ihram preparation, and health advice before departure.

## Before the Hajj: Arriving in Mecca

Most pilgrims arrive 2-3 days before the Hajj begins to perform **Umrah** — the lesser pilgrimage that includes tawaf (seven circuits of the Kaaba) and sa'i (seven lengths between the hills of Safa and Marwa). Performing Umrah before Hajj is the practice known as Hajj al-Tamattu, the most common form.

After Umrah, you exit ihram and wait in your hotel until the 8th of Dhul Hijjah, when Hajj begins. Use these days to rest, pray in the Grand Mosque, and prepare physically for the demands ahead.

On the morning of the 8th, re-enter **ihram** at your hotel. Perform the ritual bath, put on your ihram garments, and declare your intention (niyyah) for Hajj. The state of ihram is now in effect until the 10th of Dhul Hijjah.

## Day 1 (8th Dhul Hijjah): Mecca to Mina

### Morning

After entering ihram, travel to **Mina** — a tent city in the valley east of Mecca, approximately 8 kilometers from the Grand Mosque. Your Hajj agency assigns your tent location. Transport is typically by bus, though the distance is walkable.

Mina's tent city is one of the world's most extraordinary temporary settlements: over 100,000 climate-controlled tents organized by country, agency, and group. The tents are basic but functional — sleeping mats, shared bathrooms, communal meal service.

### Afternoon and Evening

This is a day of prayer and preparation. Perform the Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers in Mina, each shortened as prescribed for travelers. The atmosphere is one of anticipation — two million people preparing for the spiritual climax of the Hajj at Arafat tomorrow.

Rest as much as possible. Tomorrow is the longest and most physically demanding day.

---

## Day 2 (9th Dhul Hijjah): The Day of Arafat

### Morning

Depart Mina after the Fajr prayer for the **Plain of Arafat**, 14 kilometers to the east. Transport is by bus. The journey can take hours due to the volume of pilgrims moving simultaneously.

### Noon to Sunset

**The Standing at Arafat** (Wuquf) begins after noon and continues until sunset. This is the spiritual heart of the Hajj — scholars say that missing Arafat means missing the Hajj entirely, and that the Hajj is Arafat.

The standing is not a physical standing but a state of devoted supplication. Pilgrims pray, recite the Quran, make personal dua (supplication), and seek forgiveness. Many weep. The emotional intensity is overwhelming. The sense of two million people simultaneously turning toward God in the same act of devotion creates an experience that pilgrims describe as the closest they have felt to the divine.

The **Mount of Mercy** (Jabal al-Rahmah) at the center of the plain is where the Prophet delivered his farewell sermon. Reaching it is not required and the crowds around the hill are extreme. Praying anywhere on the plain of Arafat fulfills the obligation.

Combine Dhuhr and Asr prayers (shortened) at noon.

### After Sunset: Muzdalifah

Immediately after sunset, depart Arafat for **Muzdalifah** — an open plain between Arafat and Mina. The journey is 9 kilometers and can take 3-5 hours due to crowd movement. Many pilgrims walk part of the distance.

At Muzdalifah, perform Maghrib and Isha prayers (combined and shortened). **Collect 49-70 small pebbles** (chickpea-sized) from the ground — these will be used for the stoning ritual over the next three days. Sleep in the open air under the sky. Blankets and sleeping mats are available from your agency. The experience of sleeping on the open ground with two million fellow pilgrims is one of the Hajj's most humbling moments.

---

## Day 3 (10th Dhul Hijjah): Eid al-Adha

This is the busiest and most complex day of the Hajj, with four major rituals performed in sequence.

### 1. Stoning of Jamarat al-Aqaba

Depart Muzdalifah after Fajr prayer for **Mina**. At the **Jamarat Bridge** (a multi-level structure built to manage crowd flow), stone the largest pillar (Jamarat al-Aqaba) with **seven pebbles**, saying "Allahu Akbar" with each throw. The modern bridge design distributes pilgrims across multiple levels. Follow your group leader's guidance on timing and flow.

### 2. Animal Sacrifice

After stoning, arrange the **qurbani** (animal sacrifice) commemorating Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son. Most pilgrims pay their Hajj agency to handle this — you receive confirmation when it is complete. The meat is distributed to the poor. This sacrifice coincides with Eid al-Adha celebrations worldwide.

### 3. Hair Cutting

Men shave their heads or trim their hair. Women cut a fingertip length from their hair. This marks the **partial exit from ihram** — most ihram restrictions are now lifted except for marital relations.

### 4. Tawaf al-Ifadah and Sa'i

Travel to the **Grand Mosque in Mecca** to perform the obligatory tawaf (seven circuits of the Kaaba) and sa'i (seven lengths between Safa and Marwa). This tawaf is the most important of the Hajj — it is not optional. The Grand Mosque is extremely crowded on this day; many pilgrims delay until the 11th or 12th. Upper levels and the roof are less congested than the ground floor around the Kaaba.

After completing tawaf and sa'i, ihram is fully exited.

Return to **Mina** to sleep.

---

## Days 4-5 (11th-12th Dhul Hijjah): Days of Tashreeq

### Both Days

Each day, stone **all three pillars** at the Jamarat in sequence — smallest (Jamarat al-Ula) first, then middle (Jamarat al-Wusta), then largest (Jamarat al-Aqaba). Seven pebbles at each pillar, 21 pebbles per day. Stone after the Dhuhr prayer (stoning before noon is not valid on these days).

Between stonings, spend time in Mina in prayer, Quran recitation, and rest. The days of Tashreeq have a different character from the intense first three days — the major rituals are complete and the atmosphere becomes reflective.

**Departure option**: pilgrims may leave Mina after stoning on the 12th, provided they depart before sunset. If still in Mina at sunset on the 12th, they must stay and stone again on the 13th.

---

## Farewell Tawaf

Before leaving Mecca, every pilgrim must perform the **Tawaf al-Wada** (farewell circumambulation) — seven circuits of the Kaaba as the final act of the Hajj. This is performed in regular clothing (not ihram). The emotional weight of this final tawaf is profound — many pilgrims are unsure if they will ever return.

---

## Medina Extension (3-4 Days)

Most Hajj packages include time in [Medina](/places/medina), home of the Prophet's Mosque. The visit is typically scheduled before or after the Hajj rituals.

### Day 1: The Prophet's Mosque

The Prophet's Mosque is open 24 hours. Spend your first day in prayer and exploration. The mosque's vast expansion accommodates over one million worshippers, but its spiritual center remains the **Rawdah** — the area between the Prophet's tomb and his pulpit, described in hadith as one of the gardens of paradise. Access to the Rawdah is time-limited and gender-separated. Lines form constantly. Early morning (after Fajr) offers the shortest waits.

### Day 2: Ziyarat (Historical Sites)

A guided [ziyarat tour](/context/ziyarat-visiting-shrines-islam) visits the major historical sites: **Mount Uhud** (the battlefield where the second major battle of Islam was fought), the **Quba Mosque** (the first mosque in Islam — praying here carries special reward), the **Qiblatain Mosque** (where the direction of prayer was changed from Jerusalem to Mecca), and the **Seven Mosques** (commemorating the Battle of the Trench).

### Day 3: Reflection

A final day for prayer at the Prophet's Mosque, shopping in the market district surrounding the Haram, and reflection on the journey. Medina's atmosphere is gentler than Mecca's — the city is called the Radiant City (Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah), and its calmer pace provides space to process the transformative intensity of the Hajj.

## Practical Notes

The physical demands of Hajj cannot be overstated. You will walk 10-20 kilometers per day for five consecutive days in extreme heat and dense crowds. Start a walking program eight weeks before departure. Carry water at all times. Use an umbrella for shade.

The Hajj is intensely communal — you are never alone, which is both its power and its challenge. Patience, generosity, and tolerance are not just spiritual virtues during Hajj but practical survival skills. The crowds, the waiting, the heat, the fatigue — Islamic tradition teaches that bearing these difficulties with grace is itself an act of worship.

For the theological context that transforms these physical rituals into spiritual practice, explore the [five pillars and the Hajj's place within Islam](/context/five-pillars-hajj-explained), the story of [Ibn Battuta](/stories/ibn-battuta-pilgrim-traveler) whose legendary journey began as a Hajj pilgrimage, and the broader [Islamic pilgrimage traditions](/journeys/islamic-pilgrimage-traditions) hub page.
