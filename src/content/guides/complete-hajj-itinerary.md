The Hajj compresses the most profound spiritual journey in Islam into five days of physical ritual. Over two million pilgrims move together through a prescribed sequence of sites — Mina, Arafat, Muzdalifah, and back — performing acts that reenact the trials of Ibrahim, Hajar, and Ismail. The logistics are managed by the Saudi government and your Hajj agency, but understanding the ritual sequence before you arrive transforms the experience from a bewildering crowd movement into a conscious spiritual journey.

This itinerary covers the full Hajj ritual with a Medina extension — the most common format. Read the [Hajj and Umrah planning guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/planning-your-hajj-or-umrah) for visa details, ihram requirements, health preparation, and budget information.

## Before the Hajj: Arrival in Mecca

Most pilgrims arrive in Mecca 2-5 days before the Hajj begins. Use this time for Umrah — the lesser pilgrimage — and to acclimate to the heat, the crowds, and the emotional intensity of the Grand Mosque.

**Umrah Rituals**: Enter the state of ihram at your designated miqat (boundary point). Upon reaching the Grand Mosque, perform Tawaf — seven counterclockwise circuits of the Kaaba. The Kaaba is smaller than most pilgrims expect. Its black-draped simplicity, surrounded by a sea of white-clad worshippers circling in unison, is the single most powerful image in Islam. After Tawaf, perform Sa'i — walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa inside the mosque complex, retracing Hajar's desperate search for water for her infant son Ismail. The distance is approximately 3.5 kilometers total.

**Orientation**: Familiarize yourself with the Grand Mosque layout, the location of your hotel, the route to the bus staging area for Mina, and the facilities available in the mosque. Learn the locations of restrooms, water stations (Zamzam water fountains are throughout the mosque), and the medical aid stations. This orientation prevents disorientation during the intense days ahead.

**Rest and Prayer**: Spend time in prayer and reflection. The days before the Hajj are preparation — physical and spiritual. Sleep as much as you can. The ritual days ahead are physically demanding and sleep-deprived.

## Day 1: 8th Dhul Hijjah — Yawm al-Tarwiyah (Day of Quenching)

**Morning — Enter Ihram for Hajj**

If you exited ihram after Umrah, re-enter it. Make the niyyah (intention) for Hajj. Begin reciting the Talbiyah: "Labbayk Allāhumma labbayk" — "Here I am, O God, here I am." This response to God's call, repeated continuously throughout the Hajj, is the pilgrim's declaration of presence and submission.

**Transport to Mina**

Travel to Mina — a tent city in a valley 8 kilometers east of the Grand Mosque. Your Hajj agency arranges transport and assigns your tent. The Mina encampment is organized by nationality and agency. Locate your tent, your group leader, and the nearest facilities.

**Day and Night in Mina**

This is a day of preparation and prayer. Perform the five daily prayers. Rest. The tent city is climate-controlled (air conditioning was installed in recent decades) but crowded. The atmosphere is one of collective anticipation — millions of people gathered with a single purpose.

Sleep in Mina. Tomorrow is the spiritual climax of the entire pilgrimage.

## Day 2: 9th Dhul Hijjah — Yawm al-Arafah (Day of Arafat)

**This is the most important day of the Hajj.** The Prophet Muhammad said: "Hajj is Arafat." Missing this day invalidates the entire pilgrimage.

**Morning — Travel to Arafat**

After Fajr prayer, travel from Mina to the plain of Arafat (approximately 14 kilometers further east). The journey by bus takes longer than the distance suggests due to the movement of millions.

**Noon to Sunset — Standing at Arafat (Wuquf)**

The Wuquf — standing in prayer and supplication on the plain of Arafat — is the Hajj's spiritual core. From noon until sunset, pilgrims stand in prayer, supplication, and tears. This is the moment of raw encounter with God. Many Muslims consider it a rehearsal for the Day of Judgment, when all humanity will stand before God.

There is no prescribed prayer or ritual for the hours at Arafat — it is pure supplication. Raise your hands. Ask for forgiveness. Pray for those you love. Weep. The emotional intensity of two million people simultaneously in this state of raw petition is unlike anything else in human experience.

Jabal al-Rahmah (the Mount of Mercy) is the hill where the Prophet delivered his Farewell Sermon. Reaching it is optional and often impossible due to crowds. The standing is valid anywhere within the boundaries of Arafat.

**Sunset — Departure to Muzdalifah**

After sunset, travel from Arafat to Muzdalifah (approximately 9 kilometers west, back toward Mina). The movement of millions creates extraordinary congestion. The journey may take hours. Be patient — this is the Hajj's greatest logistical bottleneck.

**Night at Muzdalifah**

Sleep under the open sky on the plain of Muzdalifah. Pray Maghrib and Isha together (combined and shortened). Collect 49-70 small pebbles (chickpea-sized) for the stoning rituals over the coming days. The night in Muzdalifah is one of the Hajj's most memorable experiences — millions sleeping on the ground beneath the stars, the sound of Talbiyah echoing across the plain.

Vulnerable pilgrims (elderly, women with children, those with health conditions) may leave Muzdalifah after midnight for Mina. Others remain until after Fajr prayer.

## Day 3: 10th Dhul Hijjah — Yawm al-Nahr (Day of Sacrifice / Eid al-Adha)

The busiest and most complex day, with four rituals performed in sequence.

**Morning — Stoning of the Jamarat al-Aqaba**

Travel from Muzdalifah to Mina. At the Jamarat complex — a multi-level modern structure designed to handle millions — stone the largest pillar (Jamarat al-Aqaba) with seven pebbles. Each pebble is thrown individually while saying "Bismillah, Allahu Akbar" (In the name of God, God is greatest). This ritual reenacts Ibrahim's rejection of Satan's temptation to disobey God's command to sacrifice his son.

The Jamarat complex has five levels to distribute crowds. Follow your group leader's instructions on which level to use. The stoning can be performed from dawn until after midnight, and authorities encourage pilgrims to avoid the midday peak.

**Animal Sacrifice (Qurbani)**

Arrange the sacrifice through your Hajj agency. You pay the cost (approximately $100-200) and they handle the logistics — the animal is sacrificed by authorized butchers, and the meat is distributed to the poor. You do not need to witness the sacrifice, though some pilgrims choose to.

**Hair Cutting or Shaving**

Men shave their heads or cut their hair short. Women cut a fingertip-length from the ends of their hair. Barbers set up throughout Mina during these days.

**Partial Exit from Ihram**

After the stoning and hair cutting, most ihram restrictions are lifted. You may change clothes, wear scent, and resume normal dress. The prohibition on marital relations remains until Tawaf al-Ifadah is completed.

**Tawaf al-Ifadah**

Travel to the Grand Mosque in Mecca and perform the obligatory Tawaf — seven circuits of the Kaaba — followed by Sa'i (seven walks between Safa and Marwa). This Tawaf is a pillar of Hajj and cannot be skipped. It may be performed anytime on this day or the following days, but earlier is better to avoid the cumulative crowd pressure.

After Tawaf al-Ifadah, all ihram restrictions are fully lifted.

**Return to Mina**

Return to your tent in Mina for the night.

## Days 4-5: 11th-12th Dhul Hijjah — Ayyam al-Tashriq (Days of Drying Meat)

**Each Day — Stoning of All Three Pillars**

After the sun passes its zenith, stone all three pillars in sequence: the small (Jamarat al-Sughra), then the medium (Jamarat al-Wusta), then the large (Jamarat al-Aqaba). Seven pebbles at each pillar. After stoning the small and medium pillars, pause to make dua (supplication) facing Mecca.

**12th Dhul Hijjah — Departure Decision**

Pilgrims who wish to leave Mina on the 12th must complete their stoning and depart before sunset. Those who remain must stone again on the 13th. Most Hajj agencies depart on the 12th.

## Farewell Tawaf

Before leaving Mecca, perform the Tawaf al-Wida (Farewell Tawaf) — seven final circuits of the Kaaba. This should be the last act you perform in Mecca. Menstruating women are exempt from this Tawaf.

The Farewell Tawaf is emotionally overwhelming. You are leaving the holiest place on earth, unsure if you will ever return. Many pilgrims weep openly. The tradition is to walk backward from the Kaaba, keeping it in view as long as possible.

## Medina Extension: 3-4 Days

Most pilgrims extend to [Medina](/places/medina), the Prophet's city. Travel is by bus (5-6 hours) or high-speed rail (2.5 hours via Haramain Railway).

**The Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi)** is the spiritual heart of Medina. The mosque is open 24 hours and accommodates over one million worshippers. The architecture — white marble, soaring columns, retractable umbrellas that shade the courtyard — is both modern and majestic.

**The Rawdah** — the area between the Prophet's tomb and his pulpit, described by the Prophet as a garden of paradise — is the most sought-after prayer space in Medina. Access is time-limited and managed by mosque authorities. The lines are long. The experience of praying in this space, aware of the Prophet's presence behind the green-draped enclosure, is among the most intimate spiritual moments available in Islam.

**Ziyarat in Medina** covers the historical sites: the Quba Mosque (the first mosque in Islam, where praying equals the reward of Umrah), the Qiblatain Mosque (where the direction of prayer changed from Jerusalem to Mecca), the battlefields of Uhud and Badr, and Jannat al-Baqi cemetery where many of the Prophet's companions are buried. These can be covered in organized [ziyarat tours](/context/ziyarat-visiting-shrines-islam).

**Al-Baqi Cemetery** adjacent to the Prophet's Mosque is one of the most sacred burial grounds in Islam. Many of the Prophet's family members and companions rest here. The site is open for limited visiting hours. Stand at the boundary and offer prayers for the deceased — the simplicity of the graves, in contrast to the magnificence of the mosque, is a powerful reminder of Islamic egalitarianism before death.

## Connecting to the Wider Pilgrimage

The Hajj sits at the center of [Islamic pilgrimage traditions](/journeys/islamic-pilgrimage-traditions). The rituals reenact events from the story of Ibrahim that are shared across the Abrahamic traditions — the same patriarch honored at the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron, near [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem). The [five pillars framework](/context/five-pillars-hajj-explained) places the Hajj as the culmination of Islamic practice, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation that marks the ultimate submission to God.

[Ibn Battuta's](/stories/ibn-battuta-pilgrim-traveler) famous journey began as a Hajj from Morocco in 1325 and became one of history's greatest travel narratives — a reminder that the Hajj has always been both a spiritual terminus and a starting point for wider exploration of the Muslim world.

The physical intensity of the Hajj — the walking, the heat, the sleep deprivation, the emotional rawness — parallels the demanding aspects of every pilgrimage tradition. The [Camino](/cities/santiago-de-compostela) breaks you down with kilometers. [Varanasi](/cities/varanasi) confronts you with mortality. The Hajj does both simultaneously, compressing the transformative experience that other pilgrimages spread over weeks into five extraordinary days.
