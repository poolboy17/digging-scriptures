The last 100 kilometers of the Camino Francés — from Sarria to [Santiago de Compostela](/places/santiago-de-compostela) — is the most walked section of the most walked pilgrimage route in the world. It meets the minimum distance requirement for the Compostela certificate, fits into a week of vacation, and passes through the green hills and eucalyptus forests of Galicia that many returning pilgrims call their favorite landscape on the entire 800-kilometer route.

The trade-off is crowds. This section carries the highest pilgrim density of any Camino segment. In summer, albergues fill by early afternoon. The social atmosphere is intense — a compressed version of the community that builds more gradually on the full Francés. For first-time pilgrims testing whether long-distance walking pilgrimage suits them, and for experienced walkers with limited time, this week provides a genuine Camino experience.

Read the [Camino planning guide](/cities/santiago-de-compostela/planning-your-camino-pilgrimage) for credencial details, packing advice, training recommendations, and budget information.

## Getting to Sarria

Sarria is the standard starting point for the last 100 kilometers. From Santiago, take the RENFE train to Sarria (2.5-3 hours, approximately €15-20). From Madrid, trains run to Sarria via Monforte de Lemos (5-6 hours). From Lugo, buses run frequently (1 hour).

Arrive in Sarria the afternoon or evening before you plan to walk. Collect your credencial if you do not already have one — the pilgrim association office in Sarria and several albergues sell them for €2-3. Get your first stamp.

**Critical rule for the last 100km**: you need a minimum of two credencial stamps per day to qualify for the Compostela. Stamp at albergues, churches, bars, and municipal offices along the route. Do not forget — the Pilgrim Office in Santiago will check.

## Day 1: Sarria to Portomarín — 22.2km

**Terrain**: Gentle hills through farmland and eucalyptus forest. Rural Galicia at its most characteristic — stone walls, hórreos (granite grain stores on stilts), small villages with Romanesque churches. The path is well-marked with yellow arrows and stone waymarkers showing the remaining distance to Santiago.

**Highlights**: The medieval bridge at Sarria, the Romanesque church at Barbadelo, and the long descent to the reservoir at Portomarín. The town itself was relocated stone by stone when the original site was flooded by a dam in the 1960s. The Romanesque Church of San Nicolás was dismantled and rebuilt on higher ground — each stone numbered for reassembly.

**Accommodation**: Portomarín has multiple albergues (municipal and private), hotels, and pensions. The municipal albergue on the main square is the largest. In summer, arrive by 2pm for a bed.

**Difficulty**: Moderate. The distance is longer than subsequent days to build in margin for the total 100km requirement. If 22km feels ambitious for a first day, consider starting a day earlier from O Cebreiro (152km) and spreading the distance across more stages.

## Day 2: Portomarín to Palas de Rei — 24.8km

**Terrain**: The longest day. Rolling hills through oak and eucalyptus forest, small hamlets, and open farmland. The path crosses several small ridges — none steep, but the cumulative elevation gain makes this the most physically demanding stage.

**Highlights**: The Romanesque church at Vilar de Donas, a 2-kilometer detour off the main route and well worth the extra distance. The church houses remarkably preserved fourteenth-century frescoes and the tombs of the Knights of the Order of Santiago, who protected pilgrims on this route for centuries.

**Accommodation**: Palas de Rei is a small town with adequate services. Multiple albergues, several restaurants, a pharmacy, and a supermarket for restocking supplies.

**Difficulty**: Challenging due to distance. This is where blisters typically announce themselves. Address hot spots immediately — do not wait until they worsen. Compeed patches applied early prevent days of pain.

## Day 3: Palas de Rei to Arzúa — 28.5km

**Terrain**: The longest stage, but the terrain is gentler than Day 2. The path descends gradually through wooded valleys and crosses several small rivers on medieval stone bridges. The landscape becomes progressively greener as you move west into Galicia's wetter climate.

If 28.5km is too much, split this into two days by stopping in Melide (14.7km from Palas de Rei). Melide is famous for pulpo a feira — Galician-style octopus served on wooden plates with olive oil, sea salt, and paprika. The Pulpería Ezequiel has been serving it to pilgrims since the 1960s.

**Highlights**: The medieval bridge at Furelos, the town of Melide and its octopus tradition, and the crossing into the final 40 kilometers. The landscape shifts here — more dairy farms, more eucalyptus, the air damper and greener. You are entering the wet, lush world of Atlantic Galicia.

**Accommodation**: Arzúa has a good selection of albergues and hotels. The town is known for its cheese — Arzúa-Ulloa is a creamy, mild cow's milk cheese that appears on every Galician table.

**Difficulty**: Hard due to distance. Your body has now adjusted to walking, but accumulated fatigue from three days makes the final 10 kilometers feel longer than they are. Rest at Melide if needed.

## Day 4: Arzúa to O Pedrouzo — 19.3km

**Terrain**: A shorter, easier day that serves as recovery before the final approach to Santiago. The path winds through eucalyptus groves and small farming villages. The terrain is flat to gently rolling. This is the day your body thanks you for the reduced distance.

**Highlights**: The villages along this stretch feel unchanged from the medieval pilgrimage era — stone houses, small churches, dogs that ignore pilgrims because they have seen too many to care. The quiet ordinariness of the landscape creates space for reflection. Many pilgrims report that this penultimate day brings unexpected emotion — the realization that the walk is nearly finished, that the rhythm you have built will soon end.

**Accommodation**: O Pedrouzo (also called Arca) is the standard last stop before Santiago. Albergues and hotels fill quickly in season — arrive early. Rest well tonight. Tomorrow matters.

**Difficulty**: Easy to moderate. The reduced distance is deliberate — you want fresh legs for the final approach.

## Day 5: O Pedrouzo to Santiago de Compostela — 19.4km

**Terrain**: The final day. The path passes through eucalyptus forest and suburban development before reaching the outskirts of Santiago. The last 5 kilometers cross the Santiago urban area, following Camino markers through neighborhoods and parks to the cathedral.

**The Approach to Santiago**: The moment you see the spires of the cathedral from Monte do Gozo (the Hill of Joy, 5km from the city center) is one of the great emotional peaks of any pilgrimage anywhere. Medieval pilgrims raced each other to this viewpoint — the first to see the cathedral was nicknamed "the king" of their group. The view today includes modern Santiago's sprawl, but the cathedral towers remain the focal point, just as they were for the [original pilgrims](/stories/legend-of-saint-james) a thousand years ago.

Enter the old city through the Porta do Camiño. Follow the shells embedded in the pavement through narrow medieval streets. Pass through the tunnel under the Pazo de Raxoi and emerge into the Praza do Obradoiro. The cathedral's Baroque western façade fills your vision.

**At the Cathedral**: Enter through the Pórtico de la Gloria (Romanesque masterpiece, recently restored). Tradition dictates three acts: embrace the statue of Saint James behind the high altar, visit his crypt beneath the altar, and — if you have carried a stone from home — leave it at the Cruz de Ferro marker (you passed this if you walked from further back on the Francés). Attend the Pilgrims' Mass at noon, where the botafumeiro (giant incense burner) may be swung from the transept ceiling on special occasions.

**Pilgrim Office**: Visit the Oficina del Peregrino on Rúa Carretas to receive your Compostela. Present your credencial with stamps from each day (minimum two per day for the last 100km section). The office is open 8am-8pm in high season. Expect a wait of 30-90 minutes. The certificate, printed in Latin, certifies that you completed the pilgrimage for religious or spiritual reasons.

## Day 6: Santiago de Compostela

**Morning — Cathedral Museum and Rooftops**

With the walking complete, explore what you were too emotional or exhausted to absorb yesterday. The Cathedral Museum houses the original stone choir by Master Mateo. The rooftop tour provides panoramic views of the city from the cathedral's towers — a perspective that connects the medieval street plan to the pilgrimage routes radiating outward in every direction.

**Afternoon — Explore the Old Town**

Santiago's granite old town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The narrow streets, arcaded plazas, and Romanesque churches reward aimless wandering. Visit the market (Mercado de Abastos) for Galician seafood — percebes (goose barnacles), pulpo, and empanada gallega.

**Evening — Celebration Dinner**

You earned it. Galician cuisine is among Spain's best — seafood from the Rías Baixas, Albariño wine, Padrón peppers, tarta de Santiago (almond cake dusted with powdered sugar in the shape of the Cross of Santiago). The restaurants on Rúa do Franco and Rúa da Raíña serve traditional cuisine in medieval stone dining rooms.

## Day 7: Finisterre Extension (Optional)

Many pilgrims continue 90 kilometers west to Finisterre — the "end of the earth" — where pre-Christian tradition held that the sun died each evening in the Atlantic. The walk takes three additional days, or buses make the trip in 2-3 hours. At the lighthouse on the cape, pilgrims traditionally burn an item of clothing or their walking shoes — a symbolic end to the journey. The sunset from Finisterre is the unofficial final act of the Camino.

## Connecting to the Wider Pilgrimage

The Camino connects to a network of European pilgrimage routes that links Santiago to [Rome](/cities/rome) (via the Via Francigena in reverse) and [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) (the third of the great medieval pilgrimages). The [history of Christian pilgrimage](/context/history-of-christian-pilgrimage) traces how these three cities became the defining destinations of the medieval religious imagination.

The Kumano Kodō in [Japan](/cities/kyoto) is the Camino's twin — the only other UNESCO-designated pilgrimage route. The [7-day Japan itinerary](/cities/kyoto/7-days-in-sacred-japan) follows a similar structure: city temples, mountain monasticism, forest trail walking. Completing both earns the Dual Pilgrim certificate, connecting two ancient walking traditions across hemispheres.
