The last 100 kilometers of the Camino Francés — from Sarria to Santiago de Compostela — is the most popular section of the entire Camino network. It meets the minimum distance requirement for the Compostela certificate, takes 5-7 days, and passes through the green rolling hills and eucalyptus forests of Galicia. For many pilgrims, this stretch serves as either an introduction to long-distance pilgrimage or the culmination of a longer journey.

Read our [Camino planning guide](/cities/santiago-de-compostela/planning-your-camino-pilgrimage) for credencial logistics. Our [Camino Francés walking guide](/cities/santiago-de-compostela/walking-guide-camino-frances-stages) covers the full 800km route in five phases, packing advice, and training recommendations before departure.

## Getting to Sarria

Sarria is the starting point for most 100km pilgrims. The town is accessible by train from Madrid (5-6 hours via Ourense) or bus from Santiago (2.5 hours) or Lugo (45 minutes). Most pilgrims arrive the evening before they start walking, check into an albergue or hotel, and obtain their credencial stamp from the church or the Sarria pilgrim office.

**Important**: For the last 100km, the Pilgrim Office in Santiago requires **two stamps per day** on your credencial (not just one as on earlier sections). Stamp at your albergue each morning and at a church, bar, or municipal office along the route each afternoon.

## Stage 1: Sarria to Portomarín (22km)

The first stage is the longest and tests whether your training was sufficient. Leave Sarria early — by 7:00am if possible — to spread the distance across the coolest hours. The trail descends to the Río Miño valley, passes through small villages with Romanesque churches, and crosses the modern bridge into Portomarín.

Portomarín was relocated in the 1960s when a reservoir flooded the original town. The twelfth-century Church of San Nicolás was moved stone by stone to its current hilltop location. The town has excellent albergues, restaurants, and the first real sense of Camino community as pilgrims converge at dinner.

**Terrain**: gentle hills, paved paths, and quiet country lanes. Some road walking.

## Stage 2: Portomarín to Palas de Rei (25km)

The longest stage in this itinerary. The terrain is forested and undulating, with no significant climbs but persistent small hills that accumulate fatigue. Pass through the hamlet of Castromaior (small Romanesque church worth a stop) and the village of Airexe before reaching Palas de Rei.

If 25km feels excessive, split this stage by stopping at Gonzar or Ventas de Narón (approximately 12-13km from Portomarín). Both have albergues.

**Terrain**: forest paths, eucalyptus groves, minor road crossings. Mud after rain.

## Stage 3: Palas de Rei to Arzúa (29km or split)

This is the stage most pilgrims split into two days. The full distance is demanding, and splitting at Melide (15km from Palas de Rei) creates two comfortable days. Melide is famous for its pulperías — octopus restaurants where Galician pulpo a feira (octopus with paprika and olive oil) is served on wooden plates. Eating octopus in Melide is a Camino rite of passage.

If continuing to Arzúa (14km beyond Melide), the route follows pleasant forest and farmland. Arzúa is a small market town with good services and a sense of proximity to Santiago — two days remain.

**Terrain**: forest trails, farm tracks, some road walking. Generally gentle.

## Stage 4: Arzúa to O Pedrouzo (19km)

A relatively easy stage through eucalyptus forest and small villages. The trail is well-shaded and the terrain is mild. O Pedrouzo (also called Arca) is the traditional last overnight stop before Santiago. The atmosphere here is charged with anticipation — tomorrow you arrive.

Some pilgrims push past O Pedrouzo to shorten the final day, but the standard approach is to overnight here and walk the final 20km to Santiago in a single emotional morning.

**Terrain**: flat to gently rolling forest paths.

## Stage 5: O Pedrouzo to Santiago de Compostela (20km)

Rise early for the final walk. Most pilgrims leave before dawn to arrive at the [Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela](/places/santiago-de-compostela) by mid-morning. The route passes through Lavacolla (where medieval pilgrims bathed before entering the city), the Monte do Gozo viewpoint (where the cathedral spires first become visible — the Hill of Joy), and the expanding suburbs of Santiago before entering the old town through the Porta do Camiño.

The moment of arrival in the **Plaza del Obradoiro** — the grand square facing the cathedral's baroque western façade — is the emotional climax of the Camino. Pilgrims sit on the cobblestones, embrace fellow walkers, and simply absorb the fact that the journey is complete. Take as long as you need.

Enter the cathedral. The interior includes the crypt containing the relics of Saint James, the Pórtico de la Gloria (the twelfth-century sculptural masterpiece at the entrance, recently restored), and the botafumeiro — an enormous incense burner that swings across the transept during special masses. Check the cathedral schedule for botafumeiro masses, which do not occur daily.

### The Pilgrim Office

After the cathedral, walk to the **Pilgrim Office** (Oficina del Peregrino) on Rúa das Carretas. Present your credencial with its stamps. If walking for religious or spiritual reasons, you receive the Compostela. The office also issues a distance certificate upon request. Expect a 30-60 minute wait during peak season.

## Practical Notes

The last 100km section is busier than the rest of the Camino. In summer, albergues fill by early afternoon. Starting each day by 7:00am secures both a bed and a more peaceful walking experience before the midday wave of pilgrims.

Galician weather is unpredictable — rain gear is essential even in summer. The eucalyptus forests can be muddy after rainfall. Temperatures are generally mild (15-25°C in spring and autumn) but can be hot in July-August.

For the broader story of why this route exists and what draws hundreds of thousands of people to walk it each year, explore the [Legend of Saint James](/stories/legend-of-saint-james), the [Camino de Santiago](/routes/camino-de-santiago) route page, and the [history of Christian pilgrimage](/context/history-of-christian-pilgrimage) that connects Santiago to [Rome](/cities/rome) and [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) as the three great medieval pilgrimage destinations.
