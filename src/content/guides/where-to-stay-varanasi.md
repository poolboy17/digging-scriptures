Varanasi accommodation divides into two worlds. The old city — a labyrinth of lanes between the ghats and the main road — offers guesthouses with river views, rooftop restaurants, and immediate access to the sacred riverfront. Modern Varanasi, spreading south and west, has comfortable hotels with reliable amenities but requires auto-rickshaw rides to reach the ghats. The choice shapes your experience fundamentally.

For ghat etiquette, health precautions, and temple access, see our [planning guide](/cities/varanasi/planning-your-varanasi-pilgrimage). For day-by-day structure, see our [3-day itinerary](/cities/varanasi/3-days-in-varanasi).

## The Old City: Ghat-Side Guesthouses

Staying in the old city puts the ghats at your doorstep. You can walk to the river for sunrise in two minutes. The trade-off is narrow lanes that no vehicle can enter (luggage must be carried the last 100-500 meters), erratic electricity, basic plumbing, and noise.

**Assi Ghat area** is the most popular base for visitors. The wide ghat, relatively clean surroundings, and concentration of cafes and guesthouses create a comfortable introduction to Varanasi. The **Ganpati Guest House** has been hosting pilgrims and travelers for decades — its rooftop restaurant overlooking the ghat is an institution. Rooms from approximately ₹1,500-3,500 ($18-42).

**Dashashwamedh Ghat area** places you at the spiritual center — steps from the evening Ganga Aarti ceremony. Guesthouses here are more basic and the lanes more chaotic. The **Alka Hotel** offers river-facing rooms above the ghat. Prices from approximately ₹2,000-5,000 ($24-60).

**Meer Ghat / Manikarnika area** is for experienced India travelers. The lanes are narrower, the atmosphere more intense, and the proximity to the cremation ghats adds a layer of confrontation that some pilgrims find powerful and others find overwhelming. Budget guesthouses from ₹800-1,500 ($10-18).

**What to expect in old city guesthouses**: rooms are typically small with basic furnishings. Hot water is available but not always reliable. Wi-Fi exists but is often slow. Air conditioning is available at higher price points. The electricity cuts out periodically. The rewards — stepping onto the ghats at dawn, watching the river from your rooftop, hearing temple bells through your window — compensate for the discomfort.

## Heritage Hotels

A middle ground between ghat proximity and modern comfort. Several old city havelis (traditional mansions) have been converted into heritage hotels offering character, air conditioning, and functioning plumbing.

The **Brijrama Palace** on Darbhanga Ghat is Varanasi's finest heritage property — a restored eighteenth-century palace with river-facing rooms, a rooftop terrace, and standards approaching international boutique hotels. Rooms from approximately ₹12,000-25,000 ($145-300). It is expensive by Varanasi standards but delivers an experience unavailable elsewhere.

The **Suryauday Haveli** on Shivala Ghat offers restored rooms in a traditional mansion. The **Rashmi Guest House** near Assi Ghat provides a cleaner, better-managed version of the standard guesthouse experience.

## Cantonment and Modern Varanasi

South of the old city, the Cantonment area and the neighborhoods along the main roads (Sigra, Lanka) have modern hotels with reliable amenities — consistent hot water, air conditioning, elevators, room service. These are 3-5 kilometers from the ghats, requiring auto-rickshaw rides (₹100-200) each way.

The **Taj Ganges** and **Radisson Varanasi** represent international hotel standards at ₹8,000-15,000 ($95-180) per night. The **Hotel Surya** is a well-regarded mid-range option.

This zone suits travelers who want comfort as a base and visit the ghats as excursions. For pilgrims committed to being at the river for dawn, the 20-30 minute commute diminishes the experience.

## Sarnath

The Buddhist pilgrimage site of [Sarnath](/places/sarnath) — where the Buddha delivered his first sermon — is 10 kilometers northeast of Varanasi. Most pilgrims visit on a half-day trip from Varanasi, but staying overnight in Sarnath provides a radically different atmosphere: peaceful, spacious, and centered on Buddhist practice rather than Hindu devotion.

Several **Buddhist monasteries** in Sarnath accept guests. The **Burmese Monastery** and **Thai Monastery** offer simple rooms at nominal cost. The **Ideal Tops Hotel** near the archaeological park provides basic commercial accommodation.

Staying in Sarnath is particularly meaningful for Buddhist pilgrims visiting the [four sacred sites](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism). The Dhamek Stupa at dawn, before the tour buses arrive, is a contemplative experience that echoes the site's original purpose.

## Practical Notes

**Arrive with cash.** Many old city guesthouses and smaller hotels operate on cash only. ATMs exist near Assi Ghat and Dashashwamedh but can run empty. Bring enough rupees for your first 2-3 days.

**Booking**: for old city guesthouses, booking.com listings exist but direct contact (email or WhatsApp) often gets better rates and room assignments. For heritage and modern hotels, standard booking platforms work fine.

**Noise**: Varanasi is loud. Temple bells, boat engines, devotional music, and street activity start before dawn. Earplugs are essential if you are a light sleeper. The old city is louder than modern Varanasi.

**Getting around**: within the old city, walking is the only option — lanes are too narrow for vehicles. Between the old city and modern Varanasi, auto-rickshaws are the standard transport. Negotiate the fare before getting in or use the Ola/Uber apps.
