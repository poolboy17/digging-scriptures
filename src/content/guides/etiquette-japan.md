Japanese sacred sites operate on a system of unspoken rules that visitors are expected to intuit. The good news is that the rules are consistent — once you learn the basic patterns, they apply at virtually every shrine and temple across the country. The key distinction is between Shinto shrines (marked by torii gates) and Buddhist temples (marked by sanmon gates), though many sites blend both traditions.

For travel logistics, see our [planning guide](/cities/kyoto/planning-your-sacred-japan-trip). For the pilgrimage trail, see our [Kumano Kodō walking guide](/cities/kyoto/walking-guide-kumano-kodo-nakahechi).

## At Shinto Shrines

**Torii gate**: bow once before passing through. Walk to the side of the path — the center is reserved for the kami (deity). This is not strictly enforced but shows awareness.

**Temizuya** (purification fountain): most shrines have a water basin at the entrance. The correct sequence is: take the ladle with your right hand, pour water over your left hand, switch hands and rinse the right, then pour a small amount into your cupped left hand to rinse your mouth (spit to the side, not back into the basin), and rinse the left hand again. Finally, tilt the ladle upright so remaining water runs down the handle. Since COVID, many temizuya are closed or decorative — if water is flowing, the ritual is expected.

**Prayer**: at the main hall, toss a coin (¥5 coins are considered lucky — the word for five yen, go-en, sounds like the word for good fortune), bow twice deeply, clap twice, make your prayer silently with hands together, then bow once more. This two-bow, two-clap, one-bow sequence is standard at most shrines.

**Ema** (wooden prayer plaques): available for purchase (¥500-1,000). Write your wish or prayer and hang it on the designated rack.

## At Buddhist Temples

Buddhist temples follow different protocols than Shinto shrines. There is no clapping. Prayer is conducted silently with hands pressed together (gassho).

**Incense**: many temples have a large incense burner in the courtyard. Purchase a bundle of incense (¥100-200), light it, and place it in the burner. It is customary to waft the smoke toward yourself — this is believed to have healing properties.

**Shoes**: remove shoes before entering any temple hall. Place them on the shoe rack or carry them in a bag. Socks are acceptable; bare feet are fine.

**Photography**: varies by temple. Exterior photography is almost always permitted. Interior photography is often prohibited — look for signs with a camera icon crossed out. Never photograph monks or worshippers without asking.

## Temple Lodging (Shukubō)

At [Mount Kōya](/places/mount-koya) and other temple stays, additional protocols apply. Dinner is served at a set time (typically 5:30-6:00pm) — be punctual. Morning prayers (6:00am) are optional but attending shows respect. Walk quietly in corridors. The bath (ofuro) has specific hours — bathing before dinner is standard.

See our [accommodation guide](/cities/kyoto/where-to-stay-kyoto) for details on temple lodging bookings and what to expect.

## Onsen (Hot Spring) Etiquette

Onsen bathing is communal and nude — swimsuits are not worn. Wash thoroughly at the shower station before entering the bath. Tie long hair up so it does not touch the water. Do not submerge your small towel in the bath (place it on your head or the bath edge). Enter quietly and soak — conversation is acceptable but subdued.

Tattoos remain an issue at some public onsen. Many establishments have relaxed policies, but some still prohibit tattooed bathers. Ask before visiting, or use private onsen (available at many ryokan and some trail guesthouses).

## On the Trail

The Kumano Kodō and other pilgrimage paths have their own etiquette. Greet other walkers with a simple nod or "konnichiwa." Stamp your pilgrim booklet at designated points. Do not litter. Leave ōji (trail shrines) undisturbed. If you encounter monks or pilgrims in prayer, pass quietly.
