The Camino de Santiago has its own culture — a set of unwritten rules that have evolved over centuries of shared walking. These are not religious commandments but practical conventions that make communal pilgrimage work. Understanding them before you start prevents friction and helps you integrate into the Camino community.

For route planning, see our [walking guide](/cities/santiago-de-compostela/walking-guide-camino-frances-stages). For accommodation details, see [where to stay on the Camino](/cities/santiago-de-compostela/where-to-stay-camino).

## The Credencial

Your credencial (pilgrim passport) is both your identity document and your accommodation key on the Camino. You need it to access pilgrim albergues, and you need at least two stamps per day in the last 100 kilometers to qualify for the Compostela certificate in Santiago.

Get stamps at albergues, churches, bars, municipal offices, and shops along the route. Most stamp stations are obvious — look for the Camino shell symbol and an ink pad. Never stamp someone else's credencial with your own stamps.

The credencial is available from pilgrim associations worldwide, the cathedral offices in Santiago, or from the first albergue in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. Cost is typically €2-3.

## Albergue Etiquette

Albergues are shared spaces and the code of conduct is simple: be considerate of others.

**Morning**: pack your bag the night before. Use a headlamp, not the room lights, if leaving before dawn. Keep rustling, zipping, and conversation to a minimum. The albergue community rises between 5:30 and 7:00am — the noise is inevitable but should be minimized.

**Evening**: respect quiet hours (typically 10:00pm). Keep phone calls outside the sleeping area. Headphones for music or videos.

**Kitchen**: clean up immediately after cooking. Do not leave food in the refrigerator overnight unless clearly labeled. Shared communal dinners are a Camino tradition at many albergues — participate when offered.

**Bed bugs**: check your mattress before unpacking. Keep your backpack on the rack, not the bed. If you find bed bugs, inform the hospitalero immediately. Do not shame anyone who has them — it happens to everyone and is not a hygiene issue.

**Snoring**: carry earplugs. If you are a snorer, consider sleeping near the door so you can step out if asked.

## Trail Etiquette

**Greeting**: say "Buen Camino" to fellow pilgrims. This is the universal greeting and farewell. It is almost always returned.

**Speed**: walk at your own pace. Do not feel pressure to keep up with or slow down for others. The Camino finds its own rhythms.

**Cycling pilgrims**: cyclists should yield to walkers on narrow paths. Walkers should be aware of approaching cyclists — listen for bells.

**Litter**: carry out what you carry in. The Camino's rural sections pass through farmland and forest — leaving trash is disrespectful to the landscape and the communities that maintain the trail.

**Waymarking**: follow the yellow arrows and scallop shell markers. Do not add your own markers, move existing ones, or create alternative paths.

## At the Cathedral

In [Santiago de Compostela](/places/santiago-de-compostela), the Pilgrim Office (near the cathedral) processes Compostela certificates. Bring your credencial with stamps. The queue can take 30-90 minutes in summer. The certificate is free for pilgrims who walked at least the last 100 kilometers for religious or spiritual reasons.

Inside the cathedral, visit the crypt to see the relics of Saint James. The traditional pilgrim embrace of the saint's statue behind the altar is accessible during visiting hours.

## The Spirit of the Camino

The deepest etiquette of the Camino is harder to articulate than rules about bed bugs and credencials. The tradition holds that the Camino strips away social hierarchies — the CEO and the student carry the same pack, sleep in the same room, and suffer the same blisters. Treating fellow pilgrims as equals, sharing food and stories, and accepting help when it is offered are the behaviors that sustain the Camino's distinctive atmosphere.
