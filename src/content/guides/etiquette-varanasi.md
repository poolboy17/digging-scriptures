Varanasi operates on a logic that can disorient visitors accustomed to orderly sacred sites. The sacred and the mundane exist in the same physical space — funeral pyres burn beside children playing cricket, priests perform rituals while hawkers sell souvenirs. The etiquette here is not about formal rules posted on signs but about reading context and responding with awareness.

For logistics and health advice, see our [planning guide](/cities/varanasi/planning-your-varanasi-pilgrimage). For a ghat-by-ghat breakdown, see our [walking guide](/cities/varanasi/walking-guide-varanasi-ghats).

## The Cremation Ghats

This is the most important etiquette point in Varanasi: **do not photograph the cremation ceremonies at Manikarnika or Harishchandra Ghat.** This is strictly enforced and deeply offensive to the families present. It is not a spectacle — it is the most sacred moment of a family's life, the release of a soul from the cycle of rebirth.

You may observe from the upper steps at a respectful distance. Do not approach the pyres. Do not stare openly. If you want to understand what you are witnessing, hire a registered guide before visiting — they will explain the theology and the process while helping you navigate the space respectfully.

Self-appointed "guides" near the cremation ghats will approach offering explanations and then request money for "wood donations" or "cremation costs." Most are not affiliated with the Dom community that manages the cremation services. Politely decline.

## Photography

Beyond the cremation ghats, photography in Varanasi requires constant judgment. The general principle: people bathing at the ghats are performing a sacred act. Photographing them without consent is invasive. Photographing the ghats themselves — the architecture, the stairs, the boats — is fine.

When in doubt, ask. Most Varanasi residents are accustomed to visitors and will either agree or decline. Sadhus (holy men) who are visibly positioned for tourist interaction usually expect a small tip (₹20-50) for photographs. Those who are genuinely meditating or performing rituals should not be disturbed.

## Temple Access

**Kashi Vishwanath Temple** (the Golden Temple) is open to Hindu visitors. Non-Hindus can access the viewing corridor (the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor) for views of the temple exterior but cannot enter the inner sanctum. Online booking reduces the queue from hours to minutes. No phones, cameras, bags, or shoes are permitted inside.

Most smaller temples along the ghats are open to all visitors. Remove shoes before entering. Do not touch the murti (deity image) unless invited to do so by a priest. If offered prasad (blessed food), accept it with your right hand.

## The Ganges

Bathing in the Ganges is a sacred act for Hindus. If you choose to enter the water, be aware of the health risks — the river carries significant bacterial contamination. Many visitors make a symbolic gesture (touching water to the forehead) rather than full immersion.

Do not throw trash in the river. Do not use soap or shampoo in the river. These are both legal offenses and spiritual transgressions.

## Boat Rides

Dawn boat rides are the quintessential Varanasi experience. Negotiate the fare before boarding — ₹200-500 for a shared boat, ₹1,500-2,500 for a private boat, per hour. Your boatman will pause near Manikarnika Ghat — observe quietly from the water. This is an acceptable viewing distance.

The evening Ganga Aarti at [Dashashwamedh Ghat](/cities/varanasi/walking-guide-varanasi-ghats) can also be watched from a boat. Arrive 30-45 minutes early to secure a position.

## General Conduct

Use your right hand for giving and receiving — the left hand is considered unclean. Remove shoes before entering any home or sacred space. Dress modestly, particularly women — shoulders and knees covered. Avoid public displays of affection.

Cows are sacred and have right of way on every street and staircase. Do not push, hit, or startle them.
