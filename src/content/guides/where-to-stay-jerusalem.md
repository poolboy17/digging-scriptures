Where you sleep in Jerusalem shapes the pilgrimage. Staying inside the Old City walls means waking to the muezzin's call and walking to the Western Wall before the crowds arrive. Staying on the Mount of Olives means watching sunrise paint the Dome of the Rock gold from your window. Staying in West Jerusalem means modern comfort and easy transit but a taxi ride to the sacred sites.

This guide covers the neighborhoods that matter most for pilgrims, with accommodation types ranging from monastic guesthouses to boutique hotels. For visa logistics, Shabbat schedules, and site access rules, see our [planning guide](/cities/jerusalem/planning-your-jerusalem-pilgrimage). For how to sequence your days, see our [3-day itinerary](/cities/jerusalem/3-days-in-jerusalem).

## Inside the Old City Walls

Staying within the walls puts you steps from the Holy Sepulchre, the Western Wall, and the Via Dolorosa. The trade-off is noise, narrow lanes with luggage, and limited modern amenities.

**Christian hospices** are the classic pilgrim accommodation. These are guesthouses run by religious orders — not hostels, but clean, simple rooms with shared or private bathrooms, often including breakfast. They occupy some of the Old City's most remarkable buildings.

The **Austrian Hospice** on the Via Dolorosa is the most famous. Built in 1863 as a pilgrimage house for Austro-Hungarian Catholics, it offers private rooms with high ceilings and a rooftop terrace with one of the best views in the Old City. Rooms from approximately $120-180 per night. Book well ahead — it fills months in advance during Easter and Christmas.

The **Lutheran Guesthouse** in the Muristan (Christian Quarter) provides straightforward rooms in a restored medieval building. Its location — two minutes from the Holy Sepulchre — is unbeatable. Rooms from approximately $90-130.

The **Casa Nova** guesthouses, operated by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land, offer pilgrim rooms near the Holy Sepulchre and in Bethlehem. Simple, clean, and affordable (from approximately $60-80). Priority is often given to organized pilgrim groups, but individual travelers can book directly.

The **Armenian Guest House** in the Armenian Quarter offers quiet rooms in the least-visited corner of the Old City. Less tourist traffic, more authentic atmosphere.

**Muslim Quarter guesthouses** are fewer but exist, particularly around the Damascus Gate area. Prices are typically lower ($40-70) but facilities are more basic.

## Mount of Olives

The Mount of Olives provides the iconic panoramic view of Jerusalem and proximity to Gethsemane, the Church of All Nations, and the Jewish cemetery. The neighborhood is quieter than the Old City and predominantly Arab. It is a 15-20 minute walk downhill to the Lions' Gate entrance (and a steep walk back up).

The **Seven Arches Hotel** occupies the viewpoint itself — the famous postcard panorama of the Old City is literally from this hotel's terrace. A mid-range option with rooms from approximately $100-150.

The **Mount of Olives Hotel** offers similar views at slightly lower prices. Both hotels are well-positioned for pilgrims who want to walk the [Mount of Olives descent](/cities/jerusalem/walking-guide-jerusalem-old-city) as their first activity each morning.

Several **convent and monastery guesthouses** on the Mount of Olives offer pilgrim accommodation at lower rates. The Carmelite Sisters and the Benedictine community both accept guests. These are quieter, more contemplative options.

## East Jerusalem (Outside the Walls)

The area immediately north and east of the Old City — particularly around the Damascus Gate and Salah ad-Din Street — provides good access to the Muslim Quarter and the Old City's northern gates. This area is predominantly Palestinian and has its own vibrant market culture.

**Hotels along Salah ad-Din Street** range from budget ($50-80) to mid-range ($100-150). The **Jerusalem Hotel** on Nablus Road is a well-regarded mid-range option in a renovated Ottoman-era building. The **St. George Landmark Hotel** offers colonial-era character.

East Jerusalem is the most convenient base for reaching the Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif early, as the Mughrabi Gate queue forms nearby. For Muslim pilgrims, staying in this area places you closest to Al-Aqsa.

## West Jerusalem

Modern, well-connected, and comfortable. West Jerusalem offers the widest range of international hotels, restaurants, and nightlife. The Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City is accessible by light rail from most West Jerusalem locations in 10-20 minutes.

The **Mamilla neighborhood**, just outside Jaffa Gate, is the closest West Jerusalem area to the Old City. The **David Citadel Hotel** and the **Mamilla Hotel** are luxury options within walking distance of the walls. The open-air Mamilla Mall provides dining and shopping.

**Budget travelers** should look at hostels along Jaffa Road or near the Mahane Yehuda Market (the shuk). The market neighborhood has excellent food and evening atmosphere. The **Abraham Hostel** is well-reviewed and centrally located, with dorm beds from approximately $30 and private rooms from $80.

For Jewish pilgrims, staying near the **Great Synagogue** or in the **Nachlaot** neighborhood provides proximity to synagogues and religious services.

## Ein Karem

This village on Jerusalem's western outskirts — traditionally identified as the birthplace of John the Baptist — offers a quieter, greener alternative. Two significant churches (the Church of the Visitation and the Church of St. John the Baptist) make it a pilgrimage site in its own right.

Ein Karem has several small guesthouses and B&Bs surrounded by hills and gardens. It is 20-30 minutes from the Old City by bus or taxi. It suits pilgrims who want a contemplative retreat base rather than urban immersion.

## Practical Considerations

**Shabbat** (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) affects West Jerusalem significantly — public transport stops, most shops close, and restaurants in Jewish areas shut down. East Jerusalem and the Old City's Muslim and Christian quarters are less affected. If your itinerary spans Shabbat, factor this into your accommodation choice.

**Ramadan** affects the Muslim Quarter and East Jerusalem — many restaurants close during daylight hours but the evenings become festive. The Old City is particularly atmospheric during Ramadan nights.

**Easter and Christmas** fill Old City guesthouses months ahead. Book 3-6 months in advance for these periods. Secular holidays (Passover, Sukkot) also increase demand.

**Security**: Jerusalem is generally safe for tourists, but tensions can flare with little warning, particularly around the Old City and East Jerusalem. Check current conditions before booking and register with your embassy's travel advisory service.
