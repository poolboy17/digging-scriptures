The Nakahechi route is the most accessible and best-supported of the [Kumano Kodō](/routes/kumano-kodo) pilgrimage trails. It crosses the mountainous Kii Peninsula from Tanabe on the coast to the three grand shrines of Kumano — Hongu Taisha, Hayatama Taisha, and Nachi Taisha — following a path that emperors, monks, and commoners have walked for over a thousand years. UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site in 2004, making it one of only two pilgrimage routes in the world (alongside the [Camino de Santiago](/cities/santiago-de-compostela)) to hold that distinction.

This guide covers the Nakahechi stage by stage — distances, elevation profiles, what you will encounter, and where you sleep. For JR Pass logistics, temple lodging, luggage forwarding, and cultural etiquette, see our [Japan planning guide](/cities/kyoto/planning-your-sacred-japan-trip).

## Route Overview

**Total distance**: approximately 70 kilometers from Takijiri-ōji to Kumano Nachi Taisha.
**Walking days**: 4-5 (with a bus transfer for the final section).
**Elevation**: cumulative climbing of approximately 2,500 meters across the route.
**Difficulty**: moderate — the trails are well-maintained but involve significant daily elevation gain.
**Trail surface**: mix of ancient stone-paved paths, forest trails, and occasional road sections.

The Nakahechi can be walked in either direction, but the traditional approach — and the one this guide follows — moves from the coast inland, climbing into the mountains and arriving at Kumano Hongu Taisha as the spiritual climax.

## Getting to the Trailhead

From Kyoto or Osaka, take the JR limited express to **Kii-Tanabe** station (3-4 hours from Kyoto with a change in Osaka). From Kii-Tanabe, a local bus runs to Takijiri (40 minutes, ¥950). The bus is not covered by the JR Pass — pay in cash with exact change.

Before leaving Kii-Tanabe, visit the **Tanabe City Kumano Tourism Bureau** near the station to collect your pilgrim stamp booklet, arrange luggage forwarding, and get the latest trail condition updates. The staff speak English and are the best source of practical information for the route.

## Stage 1: Takijiri-ōji to Takahara (3.7km, 2-3 hours)

**Elevation gain**: approximately 450 meters.
**Trail character**: steep forest climb on stone steps and root-covered paths.

This short but steep opening stage sets the physical and spiritual tone. The trailhead at **Takijiri-ōji** — one of the 99 sacred marker shrines (ōji) along the route — sits at the confluence of two rivers. Stamp your pilgrim booklet at the marker stone.

The climb begins immediately. Ancient stone steps ascend through dense cedar forest on a gradient that is the steepest you will encounter on the entire route. The canopy closes overhead, blocking most sunlight. Moss covers the stones. The silence is broken only by birdsong and running water.

Emerge at **Takahara** — a tiny mountain village perched on a ridge at 330 meters elevation, known as "the village in the mist" for the clouds that frequently settle around it. The village has one or two guesthouses and a stunning panoramic view of the valley below. The evening light from this ridge, especially in autumn, is among the most beautiful on the route.

**Accommodation**: Kiri-no-Sato Takahara (book through Kumano Travel).

## Stage 2: Takahara to Chikatsuyu (9.3km, 4-5 hours)

**Elevation gain/loss**: approximately 350 meters up, 500 meters down.
**Trail character**: ridge walking through cedar forest with valley views.

A longer and more varied day. The trail follows a mountain ridge through the **Hosshinmon-ōji** area, with views opening periodically across forested valleys. Several ōji shrines along the route provide natural rest stops and stamping opportunities.

The descent into **Chikatsuyu** is gradual, following a river valley through mixed forest. Chikatsuyu is a small village with basic services — a convenience store, a few guesthouses, and a communal hot spring bath (onsen). The onsen after a day of mountain walking is restorative in a way that transcends its modest facilities.

**Accommodation**: Minshuku Chikatsuyu or Kawa-no-Ie (book through Kumano Travel).

## Stage 3: Chikatsuyu to Hongū (21km, 7-8 hours)

**Elevation gain/loss**: approximately 800 meters up, 900 meters down.
**Trail character**: the longest and most demanding day — multiple mountain passes through deep forest.

This is the day that defines the Nakahechi. Three significant climbs and descents cross mountain passes where the forest is oldest and the sense of isolation is strongest. The trail alternates between pristine stone-paved sections (some dating to the medieval period) and softer forest paths.

Key waypoints include **Tsugizakura-ōji** (a particularly atmospheric shrine in a clearing), the **Mikoshi-toge Pass** (the route's physical highlight, with a challenging climb rewarded by expansive views), and the long descent into the Kumano valley.

Most walkers split this stage by overnighting at **Nonaka** (approximately 12km from Chikatsuyu), creating two manageable days instead of one grueling one. The village has limited accommodation — book well ahead.

The day ends at **Kumano Hongū Taisha** — the grand shrine and spiritual climax of the Nakahechi. The shrine's thatched-roof architecture is simpler and more austere than many Japanese shrines. The power is in the setting: the shrine stands in the mountains at the end of a journey that has taken you progressively deeper into a landscape that strips away modern distractions.

Before or after visiting the current shrine, walk 10 minutes to **Ōyunohara** — the original shrine site, now a vast gravel clearing in the river flood plain dominated by Japan's largest torii gate (33 meters tall). The scale of the torii against the mountains and sky is stunning. This site was the shrine's location for over a millennium before catastrophic flooding in 1889 forced its relocation to higher ground.

**Accommodation**: Yunomine Onsen (15 minutes by bus from Hongu). The village's **Tsuboyu** bathhouse — a tiny natural hot spring enclosed in a wooden hut, accessible to two people at a time — is the only UNESCO World Heritage-listed onsen. Book a time slot in advance.

## Stage 4: Hongū to Nachi (bus + 3km walk, half day)

**Bus**: Hongu to Koguchi or directly to Nachi (1-2 hours depending on route).
**Walking**: approximately 3 kilometers from the bus stop to the falls and shrine.

The trail between Hongu and Nachi is less walked and less well-marked than the Nakahechi. Most pilgrims take the bus for this section and walk the final approach to Nachi on foot.

**Kumano Nachi Taisha** shares a mountaintop site with the Buddhist Seiganto-ji temple — one of the few places in Japan where Shinto and Buddhist sacred architecture stand side by side in their original relationship, predating the forced separation of the two traditions in the Meiji era.

The **Nachi Falls** (133 meters, the tallest single-drop waterfall in Japan) cascade directly beside the shrine complex. The vermillion pagoda of Seiganto-ji framed against the white water is one of Japan's most photographed scenes and one of its most spiritually powerful. A stone staircase descends through ancient cedar to a viewing platform near the base of the falls.

Stamp your booklet at both the shrine and the falls. If you also complete a section of the [Camino de Santiago](/routes/camino-de-santiago), these stamps qualify you for the **Dual Pilgrim Certificate**.

From Nachi, buses connect to Kii-Katsuura station. JR trains return to Osaka (approximately 4 hours) or Kyoto (5 hours with a change).

## Trail Conditions and What to Pack

The Nakahechi is well-marked with bilingual signs (Japanese and English) and numbered waypoint markers that correspond to the official trail map. Navigation is straightforward in good conditions but can be confusing at road crossings and in fog.

**Essential gear**: hiking shoes with grip for wet stone (the trails are frequently damp), rain jacket and pants (the Kii Peninsula receives heavy rainfall), daypack (if using luggage forwarding), 1-2 liters of water, trail snacks, warm layer for mountain passes, headlamp (for early starts or late finishes), and your pilgrim stamp booklet.

**Mobile coverage**: patchy on the trails, generally available in villages. Download offline maps before setting out.

**Seasons**: spring (April-May) and autumn (October-November) are ideal. Summer is hot and humid with leeches on some forest sections. Winter is cold on the passes but quiet. The rainy season (mid-June to mid-July) makes the stone paths treacherous.
