Varanasi overwhelms. The city operates at a sensory intensity that no guidebook can fully prepare you for — the press of bodies in the narrow lanes, the smoke from the cremation ghats, the dawn chanting echoing off the river, the simultaneous presence of birth and death and commerce and devotion compressed into a riverfront that has been continuously inhabited for over three thousand years. The practical challenge is not finding things to see but creating enough structure to absorb what you encounter without being swept away by it.

This guide provides that structure — the logistical knowledge that lets you navigate Varanasi's sacred geography with confidence and respect.

## When to Go

**October through March** is the best window. Temperatures are comfortable (10-25°C), humidity is low, and the sky is clear enough for sunrise boat rides. November and February are ideal months — cool mornings create atmospheric mist on the Ganges that lifts as the sun rises, producing the most visually stunning dawn experiences.

**April through June** brings extreme heat, regularly exceeding 40°C. Walking the ghats in midday becomes genuinely dangerous. If visiting in summer, restrict outdoor activity to dawn and dusk.

**July through September** is monsoon season. The Ganges rises dramatically, flooding lower ghats and altering the riverfront landscape. Some ghats become inaccessible. The rain creates a different Varanasi — fewer tourists, intense greenery, spectacular thunderstorms — but logistics become unpredictable. Boat rides may be suspended during heavy rains.

**Dev Deepawali** (October-November, date varies) is the most spectacular festival on the ghats. Thousands of oil lamps line every step of every ghat, creating a riverfront of fire. The city is packed and accommodation must be booked months ahead, but witnessing Dev Deepawali is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

## Entry Requirements

Most Western visitors obtain an **Indian e-visa** online before travel. The e-Tourist visa costs $10-80 depending on nationality and duration (30 days, 1 year, or 5 years). Apply at least 4 days before travel through the official Indian government portal. Processing typically takes 72 hours. Print a copy of the approved e-visa to show at immigration.

Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your arrival date and have at least two blank pages for stamps.

Varanasi's Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport receives direct flights from Delhi (90 minutes), Mumbai (2 hours), and several other Indian cities. From the airport, the ride to the ghat area takes 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. Pre-arrange airport pickup through your hotel — Varanasi's auto-rickshaw negotiations at arrival can be stressful for first-time visitors.

Alternatively, trains connect Varanasi to Delhi (8-12 hours), Kolkata (8-10 hours), and most major Indian cities. Varanasi Junction (also called Varanasi Cantt) is the main station. Book trains through the IRCTC website or app.

## The Ghats: Orientation and Access

Varanasi has 84 ghats stretching along a 7-kilometer curve of the Ganges. The five most important for pilgrims are Dashashwamedh Ghat (the main ceremonial ghat), Assi Ghat (the southern boundary, peaceful and popular with visitors), Manikarnika Ghat (the primary cremation ghat), Panchganga Ghat (where five sacred rivers are believed to meet), and Harishchandra Ghat (the second cremation ghat).

The ghats are open 24 hours and free to access. The best approach for first-time visitors is a **dawn boat ride** (5:30-6:30am depending on season) from Dashashwamedh or Assi Ghat. Boats cost ₹200-500 ($2.50-6) per person for a shared ride, or ₹1,500-2,500 ($18-30) for a private boat. The dawn ride takes you past the full stretch of active ghats as pilgrims bathe, priests perform morning prayers, and the sun rises through river mist. This single experience provides the orientation and emotional preparation for everything that follows on foot.

Walking the ghats is free and requires no guide, though a knowledgeable one adds enormous value. The ghat-side walk from Assi to Manikarnika covers the essential stretch in about 90 minutes. The stone steps are uneven and sometimes slippery — wear sturdy shoes with grip.

## Ghat Etiquette

The ghats are living sacred spaces, not tourist attractions. Behavior that respects this distinction will shape how local people receive you.

At **cremation ghats** (Manikarnika and Harishchandra): observe from a respectful distance. **Do not photograph cremation ceremonies.** This is strictly enforced and deeply offensive to families present. Tout operators near Manikarnika may approach claiming to be "guides" and request money or donations for wood — most are not affiliated with the cremation services. Politely decline. If you want to understand the cremation traditions, hire a registered guide from a reputable agency before visiting.

At **bathing ghats**: people are performing religious rituals. Do not photograph individuals without permission. Do not enter the water unless you intend to participate in the ritual bathing tradition. If you do bathe, be aware that Ganges water quality is poor by Western standards — avoid submerging your head or swallowing water.

**Dress modestly** throughout the ghat area. Cover shoulders and knees. Remove shoes before entering any temple or designated sacred space.

## Kashi Vishwanath Temple

The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the most sacred Shiva temple in India and the spiritual center of Varanasi. The recently completed Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has modernized access while preserving the temple's ancient sanctity.

**Online booking** is available and recommended through the temple's official website. The online system allows you to select a time slot for darshan (viewing of the deity), reducing wait times from hours to minutes. Without a booking, expect queues of 1-3 hours during busy periods.

**Access restrictions**: only Hindus are permitted inside the inner sanctum. Non-Hindu visitors can enter the corridor and view the temple architecture from the designated areas. Security is strict — no phones, cameras, bags, or electronic devices allowed past the security checkpoint. Free locker facilities are available at the entrance gates.

The temple opens at 4am for the first aarti and closes at 9pm. The early morning aarti (4-5am) is the most spiritually intense. The evening aarti draws larger crowds.

## Sarnath: The Buddhist Circuit

[Sarnath](/places/sarnath), 10 kilometers northeast of Varanasi, is where the Buddha delivered his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. For visitors interested in the Buddhist dimension of the region's sacred geography, Sarnath is an essential half-day trip.

The Dhamek Stupa, the Ashoka Pillar, and the Sarnath Archaeological Museum (which houses the famous Lion Capital — India's national emblem) can be covered in 3-4 hours. An auto-rickshaw from the ghat area costs ₹300-500 roundtrip. The site connects Varanasi to the broader [Buddhist pilgrimage tradition](/journeys/buddhist-pilgrimage-paths) and the [four sacred sites of Buddhism](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism) across India and Nepal.

## The Ganga Aarti

The evening Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat is Varanasi's signature ritual experience. It begins at approximately 6pm in winter and 6:30pm in summer and lasts 45 minutes. Priests perform synchronized fire rituals with large brass lamps while chanting hymns to the Ganges.

**Viewing options**: from the ghat steps (arrive 45-60 minutes early for a good seat), from a boat on the river (arrange in advance — boats fill quickly), or from the upper levels of nearby buildings (some restaurants offer rooftop views). The boat perspective is the most photogenic. The ghat-level experience is the most immersive.

A smaller, more intimate aarti takes place at Assi Ghat each evening. It draws fewer tourists and many pilgrims prefer its contemplative atmosphere to the spectacle of Dashashwamedh.

## Health and Safety

Varanasi requires more health precautions than most pilgrimage destinations. Consult a travel medicine clinic before departure.

**Water**: drink only bottled or purified water. Avoid ice in drinks at street stalls. The tap water in Varanasi is not safe for drinking. Carry a reusable bottle and buy sealed water bottles (check that the seal is intact — refilled bottles circulate).

**Food**: eat at busy restaurants where food turnover is high. Street food is part of the Varanasi experience — the kachori sabzi at morning stands and the lassi at Blue Lassi Shop are legendary — but choose vendors with high local traffic and visible cooking practices.

**Air quality**: can be poor, particularly in winter when cooking fires and vehicle emissions combine with cold air. Travelers with respiratory conditions should carry appropriate medication.

**Navigation**: Varanasi's old city lanes are a maze. GPS helps but signals bounce off narrow walls. Getting lost is inevitable and usually leads to unexpected discoveries. If truly disoriented, ask for the nearest ghat — the river is always the reference point. Walking toward the river always gets you back to familiar territory.

## Connecting to the Wider Pilgrimage

Varanasi connects to every major pilgrimage tradition represented on this site. For Hindu pilgrims, it is the holiest city in India — the place where death itself leads to liberation. For Buddhist visitors, nearby Sarnath marks the beginning of the Buddha's teaching mission. For anyone interested in the [psychology of pilgrimage](/context/psychology-of-pilgrimage), Varanasi presents the most confrontational version of what sacred travel offers: an encounter with mortality that strips away comfortable illusions.

[Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) shares Varanasi's quality of being a city where the sacred permeates every surface. [Mecca](/cities/mecca-and-medina) shares its quality of being a required destination — for devout Hindus, dying in Varanasi is the ultimate aspiration, just as Hajj is the ultimate obligation for Muslims. [Kyoto](/cities/kyoto) offers the philosophical counterpart — where Japanese Buddhism emphasizes aesthetic harmony, Varanasi presents raw, unfiltered spiritual intensity.

The practical preparation in this guide creates space for that intensity to reach you. Arrive knowing the rhythms of the ghats, the etiquette of the cremation grounds, and the logistics of the temples, and you free your attention for what Varanasi actually offers: the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, still performing the rituals that have defined it for three millennia.
