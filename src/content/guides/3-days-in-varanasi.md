Three days in Varanasi lets you experience the city's three temporal rhythms: dawn on the river, the midday temple circuit, and the evening aarti ceremony. This itinerary organizes each day around a different dimension of sacred Varanasi — the river, the old city, and the Buddhist circuit — building from observation to participation as your comfort with the city deepens.

Read our [Varanasi planning guide](/cities/varanasi/planning-your-varanasi-pilgrimage) for visa requirements, and our [ghat walking guide](/cities/varanasi/walking-guide-varanasi-ghats) for a detailed stretch-by-stretch breakdown, health precautions, and ghat etiquette before you arrive.

## Day 1: The River

### Dawn (5:00am – 8:00am)

Your first encounter with Varanasi should be from the water. Arrange a **dawn boat ride** the evening before through your hotel (₹1,500-2,500 for a private boat, ₹200-500 per person shared). Depart from Dashashwamedh or Assi Ghat at 5:30am.

The boat drifts north along the full stretch of active ghats as the city wakes. Pilgrims descend the steps for ritual bathing. Priests perform morning prayers. Yoga practitioners salute the sun on the upper steps. Smoke rises from Manikarnika Ghat, where cremation fires burn continuously. The dawn light through river mist creates an atmosphere that photographs cannot capture — this is the most important single experience in Varanasi.

Ask your boatman to pause at a respectful distance from **Manikarnika Ghat** — the primary cremation ghat. Observe from the boat. Do not photograph. The boatman can explain what you are seeing if you ask. What you witness here — the transformation of death from something hidden into something visible, communal, and sacred — reframes everything that follows during your three days.

Return to your ghat by 8:00am. Breakfast at your hotel or at one of the ghat-side chai stalls.

### Morning (9:00am – 12:00pm)

Walk the ghats on foot from **Assi Ghat** northward. This is the most accessible section — the broad steps, the temples lining the riverfront, the wrestlers training at Tulsi Ghat, the silk merchants near Chet Singh Ghat. Walk slowly. Stop often. The ghats are not a route to be completed but a landscape to be absorbed.

Detour into the **old city lanes** behind the ghats. The narrow alleys (galis) are Varanasi's circulatory system — threading between temples, shops, tea stalls, and residences that have occupied this ground for centuries. Getting lost is inevitable and productive. When disoriented, walk toward the river — the ghats are always the reference point.

### Afternoon (2:00pm – 5:00pm)

Rest during the hottest hours. Varanasi's intensity demands pace management. Read, journal, or visit the **Ramnagar Fort and Museum** across the river (auto-rickshaw to the bridge, then ferry or drive — allow 2 hours total). The fort's collection includes vintage royal carriages, Mughal weapons, and astronomical instruments.

### Evening (6:00pm – 8:00pm)

The **Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat** is Varanasi's signature ceremony. Arrive by 5:15pm for a seat on the ghat steps. The ceremony begins around 6:00pm (6:30pm in summer) and lasts 45 minutes. Seven priests perform synchronized fire rituals with tiered brass lamps, bells, conch shells, and chanting. The scale is theatrical and the crowd energy is electric.

Alternatively, watch from a boat on the river — the perspective is different and the crowd pressure is absent. Reserve a boat in advance.

Dinner at one of the rooftop restaurants overlooking Dashashwamedh. The view of the post-aarti ghat — oil lamps floating on the river, lingering incense, the city slowly quieting — is the perfect close to your first day.

## Day 2: The Sacred City

### Morning (7:00am – 11:00am)

Today focuses on the old city's temple landscape. Start at the **Kashi Vishwanath Temple** — the most sacred Shiva temple in India. If you booked online (recommended), your timed entry reduces the wait dramatically. If not, expect 1-3 hours. No phones, cameras, or bags are permitted past security — use the free lockers at the entrance gates.

Non-Hindu visitors can explore the **Kashi Vishwanath Corridor** — the recently completed complex surrounding the temple — and view the temple architecture from designated areas. The corridor connects the temple directly to the ghats, creating a pilgrimage path that is both ancient in meaning and modern in infrastructure.

After the temple, visit the **Vishwanath Gali** — the narrow market street approaching the temple, packed with shops selling silk, brass, sandalwood, and religious offerings. This is where Varanasi's sacred and commercial life interweave most visibly.

### Midday (11:00am – 2:00pm)

Walk to **Manikarnika Ghat** on foot through the lanes. Approach with respect and observe from the upper steps. A registered guide (arrange through your hotel) can explain the cremation traditions, the significance of the eternal flame, and the role of the Dom community who tend the fires. Do not photograph.

The theology here is direct: Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi and being cremated on these ghats breaks the cycle of rebirth and grants moksha — liberation. Understanding this belief transforms what you see from disturbing to profound. The families present are not mourning in the Western sense — they are celebrating a soul's release.

Lunch at the **Blue Lassi Shop** (near Manikarnika) or one of the restaurants along Assi Ghat.

### Afternoon (3:00pm – 6:00pm)

Visit **Tulsi Manas Temple** (dedicated to Lord Rama, with the entire Ramcharitmanas inscribed on its marble walls) and the **Durga Temple** (known as the Monkey Temple for its resident langurs). These temples showcase different aspects of Hindu devotion — the literary tradition of Tulsi Manas and the fierce feminine divine energy of the Durga Temple.

If time allows, visit the **Bharat Kala Bhavan** museum at Banaras Hindu University — one of India's finest collections of miniature paintings, sculptures, and archaeological artifacts.

### Evening

A second evening at the ghats — but tonight, attend the **Assi Ghat aarti** instead of Dashashwamedh. The ceremony is smaller, more intimate, and draws more local devotees than tourists. The contrast with last night's Dashashwamedh spectacle reveals the range of Varanasi's devotional life.

---

## Day 3: Sarnath and Departure

### Morning (7:00am – 12:00pm)

Take an auto-rickshaw to **Sarnath** (30 minutes, ₹300-500). This is where the Buddha delivered his first sermon after attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya — the moment that set the wheel of dharma in motion and began the Buddhist tradition.

The **Dhamek Stupa** (fifth century CE, 43 meters tall) marks the traditional site of that first sermon. Walk around the stupa at the pace of the monks and pilgrims who circle it in meditation. The **Ashoka Pillar** nearby, erected by Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE, originally bore the Lion Capital that is now India's national emblem.

Visit the **Sarnath Archaeological Museum** — the finest collection of Buddhist sculpture in India. The Lion Capital itself is here, along with a stunning fifth-century Buddha figure in the teaching pose (dharmachakra mudra) that is considered one of the masterpieces of Indian art.

The **Mulagandha Kuti Vihara** (modern Buddhist temple) contains frescoes by the Japanese artist Kosetsu Nosu depicting scenes from the Buddha's life. The Bodhi tree in the garden was grown from a cutting of the Bodh Gaya tree.

Sarnath connects Varanasi to the broader [Buddhist pilgrimage tradition](/journeys/buddhist-pilgrimage-paths) and the [four sacred sites of Buddhism](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism). For visitors who have already experienced [Kyoto](/cities/kyoto) or plan to, Sarnath provides the Indian root from which Japanese Buddhism eventually flowered.

### Afternoon

Return to Varanasi for a final ghat walk. Many pilgrims find that their third-day experience of the ghats is qualitatively different from the first. The initial overwhelm has subsided. The rhythms have become familiar. What was chaotic now reads as patterned. The city has not changed — your capacity to receive it has.

A farewell visit to the Western Wall in [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) or a final walk through Kyoto's bamboo grove serves the same function: a closing encounter that consolidates three days of accumulated experience into memory.

## Practical Notes

This itinerary works in any season, though dawn boat rides may be suspended during heavy monsoon rains (July-September). Winter mornings (November-February) produce the most atmospheric river mist but require warm layers at 5:00am.

Stay near Assi Ghat or Dashashwamedh Ghat for the easiest access to both the river and the old city lanes. Heritage havelis and boutique guesthouses in the ghat area provide atmospheric accommodation. Book ahead during Dev Deepawali and other festival periods.
