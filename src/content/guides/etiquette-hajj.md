The Hajj is governed by both Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and practical protocols established by the Saudi authorities. The spiritual etiquette — the intention (niyyah), the prayers, the state of ihram — is as important as the physical rules. This guide covers both dimensions.

For the ritual sequence, see our [complete Hajj itinerary](/cities/mecca-and-medina/complete-hajj-itinerary). For physical preparation, see our [walking guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/walking-guide-hajj-rituals). For visa and health logistics, see our [planning guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/planning-your-hajj-or-umrah).

## Ihram: The Sacred State

Ihram is not just clothing — it is a state of spiritual purity entered with a specific intention (niyyah). For men, ihram consists of two unstitched white cloths — one wrapped around the waist, one draped over the left shoulder. No underwear, socks, or shoes that cover the ankles. Sandals are standard.

For women, ihram is their normal modest clothing — any color — with the face and hands uncovered (though some scholars permit face covering). The common misconception that women must wear white is incorrect.

While in ihram, the following are prohibited: cutting hair or nails, using perfume or scented soap, engaging in marital relations, hunting, arguing, and using obscene language. These prohibitions are not arbitrary restrictions but spiritual disciplines designed to focus the pilgrim entirely on worship.

## Inside the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram)

Enter with the right foot. Recite the dua for entering the mosque. Maintain wudu (ablution) at all times inside the mosque. Ablution facilities are available throughout the complex.

During tawaf (circumambulation of the Kaaba), walk counterclockwise with the Kaaba on your left. Maintain a steady pace. Do not stop suddenly. Do not push. If you need to rest, move to the outer rings where the crowd is thinner.

The Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad) is the starting point of each circuit. Touching or kissing it is sunnah but not obligatory — pointing toward it from a distance and saying "Bismillah, Allahu Akbar" is equally valid. Attempting to reach the stone through dense crowds can cause injury and is discouraged.

Men should perform raml (brisk walking) during the first three circuits of the arrival tawaf. Women walk at their normal pace.

## Sa'i: Between Safa and Marwa

Walk the seven lengths between Safa and Marwa in the designated corridor. Men should walk briskly between the green fluorescent markers. Women walk at normal pace throughout. Recite prayers or make dua during the walk.

## At Arafat

The standing (Wuquf) at Arafat is the spiritual climax of the Hajj. The entire period from noon to sunset is devoted to prayer, supplication, and repentance. This is considered the most powerful time for dua in the Islamic calendar.

Face the Qibla. Raise your hands in supplication. Cry if you feel moved to — this is not a performance but a genuine encounter with the divine. The Prophet Muhammad said there is no day on which God frees more souls from the Fire than the Day of Arafat.

## Stoning the Jamarat

Stone each pillar with seven pebbles (chickpea-sized), saying "Allahu Akbar" with each throw. Follow the crowd flow on the Jamarat Bridge — the system is designed to prevent dangerous compression. Do not stop to pick up dropped pebbles. Do not throw sandals or large stones.

The timing matters: on the 11th and 12th of Dhul Hijjah, stoning must occur after the Dhuhr prayer. Late afternoon is less crowded than immediately after noon.

## Gender-Specific Notes

Men and women perform Hajj together. There is no gender segregation during tawaf, sa'i, or at Arafat. Women who are menstruating cannot perform tawaf but may perform all other rituals. Tawaf can be completed after menstruation ends — many women delay Tawaf al-Ifadah for this reason.

Women traveling for Umrah without a mahram (male guardian) is now permitted for those over 25. During Hajj, most agencies organize travel in gender-mixed groups.

## The Prophet's Mosque (Medina)

The mosque is open 24 hours. Enter with the right foot. There is no specific ritual required — visiting Medina is recommended (mustahabb) but not a Hajj obligation.

The Rawdah (the garden of paradise between the Prophet's pulpit and his tomb) is the most sought-after prayer space. Access is regulated — follow the queue system. Do not push. Early morning (3:00-5:00am) has the shortest waiting times.

When passing the Prophet's tomb, offer the greeting of peace (salam). Do not touch, kiss, or circumambulate the tomb — these are prohibited in Islamic practice.

## Spiritual Etiquette

Beyond the physical rules, the deeper etiquette of Hajj is spiritual. Patience is itself an act of worship — the crowds, the heat, the discomfort, the waiting are not obstacles to the pilgrimage but part of it. Serve others before yourself. Help the elderly. Share your water and food. Forgive those who push or jostle.

The Prophet Muhammad's farewell sermon at Arafat emphasized equality: no Arab is superior to a non-Arab, no white person to a Black person, except through consciousness of God. The ihram garments — identical for every pilgrim regardless of wealth — embody this principle physically.
