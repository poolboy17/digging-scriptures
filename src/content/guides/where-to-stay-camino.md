The Camino de Santiago has the most developed pilgrim accommodation network in the world. From Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Santiago, you are never more than 10 kilometers from a bed. The system ranges from austere municipal albergues with bunk beds and cold showers to boutique hotels with private bathrooms and evening menus. Understanding the options — and how they shape the Camino experience — is essential for planning.

## Albergues: The Traditional Pilgrim Hostel

Albergues are the backbone of the Camino. They exist solely for pilgrims walking or cycling the route and require a credencial (pilgrim passport) for entry. Three types operate along the Francés:

**Municipal albergues** are the cheapest and most authentic. Run by local governments, they charge €6-12 per night for a bunk in a shared dormitory. Facilities are basic: bunk beds, shared bathrooms, sometimes a kitchen. They operate first-come, first-served — no reservations. Doors open in early afternoon (typically 1:00-2:00pm) and close at 10:00pm. Checkout by 8:00am.

**Parochial (donativo) albergues** are run by parishes or religious organizations on a donation basis. You pay what you can afford. Some serve communal dinners. The spiritual dimension is more present — evening prayers, pilgrim blessings, shared meals. These are often the most memorable stays on the Camino. The **albergue in Grañón** and the **parish albergue in Bercianos del Real Camino** are legendary.

**Private albergues** operate commercially. Prices range from €10-20 per night. They typically offer cleaner facilities, smaller dormitories (4-12 beds versus 20-100), and sometimes private rooms. Many accept reservations — a significant advantage in peak season. They often include amenities like Wi-Fi, towels, and laundry machines.

## Hotels, Pensiones, and Casa Rurales

Pilgrims who want private rooms have abundant options. **Pensiones** (small family-run hotels) line the Camino in every town of any size. Expect €25-50 for a private room with shared or private bathroom. **Hotels** are available in larger towns and cities for €40-80+.

**Casa rurales** (rural houses) offer a middle ground — private rooms in converted farmhouses or village homes, often with character and home-cooked meals. Prices vary from €30-60.

These options suit pilgrims who need privacy, better sleep (albergue snoring is notorious), or physical recovery after difficult stages. Many long-distance pilgrims alternate between albergues and private rooms — sleeping communally most nights but taking a hotel room every 4-5 days for rest.

## In Santiago de Compostela

Santiago has accommodation across every price range. **Pilgrim albergues** in Santiago require arrival on foot with a credencial. The large **public albergue on Rúa das Fontiñas** is the traditional first-night stop — basic but located minutes from the cathedral.

The **Parador de Santiago** (Hostal dos Reis Católicos) on the Plaza del Obradoiro is one of the world's oldest hotels — a former pilgrim hospital built by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1499. Staying here is expensive (€200-400+) but historically resonant. The hotel traditionally offered free meals to the first ten pilgrims arriving each day, though this practice has been modified over the years.

For most pilgrims, mid-range hotels and pensiones in the old town (€50-100) provide comfortable bases for exploring the cathedral and city. Book ahead in summer (July-September) when pilgrim arrivals peak.

## The Albergue Experience

For many pilgrims, albergues are the Camino. The communal sleeping, the shared bathrooms, the conversations with strangers over dinner, the 6:00am rustling of backpacks — these form the social fabric of the pilgrimage. The discomfort is part of the point.

**What to bring**: a sleeping bag (required at most municipal albergues — mattresses are provided, sheets usually not), earplugs (essential), a headlamp (for early-morning packing without waking others), flip-flops for showers, and a quick-dry towel.

**Etiquette**: pack your bag the night before to minimize morning noise. Use your headlamp, not the room lights, before dawn. Keep phone calls outside the sleeping area. Respect the 10:00pm quiet hours. Clean up after yourself in the kitchen.

**Bed bugs**: a persistent issue in some albergues. Inspect your mattress before unpacking. Keep your backpack on the luggage rack, not the bed or floor. Carry a silk sleeping bag liner as additional protection. If you encounter bed bugs, inform the hospitalero (host) — they need to know for treatment.

## Booking Strategy

**Peak season** (June-September) on the Francés requires strategy. Municipal albergues fill by early afternoon — start walking by 7:00am and arrive at your intended stop by 1:00-2:00pm. If you arrive to find an albergue full, the next one is typically 5-10 kilometers ahead.

**Off-season** (November-March) many albergues close entirely. Check availability in advance. The route is still walkable but accommodation gaps widen, especially in rural areas.

**The last 100 kilometers** (Sarria to Santiago) is the busiest section year-round. Accommodation fills fastest here. Private albergues that accept reservations are worth the premium.
