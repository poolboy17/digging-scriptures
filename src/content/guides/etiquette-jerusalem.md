Jerusalem's sacred sites belong to living religious communities. The etiquette required at each site reflects not just cultural sensitivity but active worship — people are praying, mourning, and celebrating around you. Getting the protocols right is not about avoiding embarrassment but about participating respectfully in spaces that billions consider the holiest on earth.

For practical logistics, see our [planning guide](/cities/jerusalem/planning-your-jerusalem-pilgrimage). For how to sequence your visits, see our [3-day itinerary](/cities/jerusalem/3-days-in-jerusalem) and [walking guide](/cities/jerusalem/walking-guide-jerusalem-old-city).

## Dress Code: The Universal Rule

Modest dress is required at every sacred site in Jerusalem regardless of faith. For both men and women, this means shoulders covered and knees covered. Women should carry a scarf that can cover the head when needed. Men need a head covering (kippah) at the Western Wall and Jewish sites — free paper kippot are available at the entrance.

At the [Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif](/places/dome-of-the-rock), enforcement is strict. Shorts, sleeveless tops, and low-cut clothing will result in denied entry. Non-Muslim visitors cannot bring religious items — Bibles, prayer books, visible crosses, or Stars of David.

At the [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](/places/jerusalem-old-city), bare shoulders and shorts are turned away at the entrance. The enforcement is inconsistent but real.

The practical solution: wear lightweight trousers or a long skirt and a top that covers shoulders. This combination works at every site in the city without adjustment.

## The Western Wall

The [Western Wall](/places/western-wall) plaza is accessible 24 hours and free of charge. The prayer area is gender-separated — men on the left, women on the right. Approach the wall quietly. Many people are in deep prayer. You may touch the wall, place a written prayer in the cracks, and stand silently.

Do not take photographs on Shabbat (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) or Jewish holidays. Photography is technically permitted on other days but should be done discreetly and never pointed directly at people praying without their consent. Selfies at the wall are increasingly common but remain controversial.

Leaving the wall: tradition holds that you should not turn your back on the wall. Walk backward for several steps before turning away.

## The Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif

Non-Muslim access is restricted to specific morning hours (typically 7:30-11:00am, Sunday through Thursday) through the Mughrabi Gate only. Hours change without notice. Confirm the current schedule the evening before.

You cannot enter the [Dome of the Rock](/places/dome-of-the-rock) or [Al-Aqsa Mosque](/places/al-aqsa-mosque) as a non-Muslim visitor. The 35-acre platform itself is accessible.

Behavior on the platform should be subdued. Do not pray visibly (this has been a source of conflict), do not sing, do not make loud conversation. Treat this as one of the most contested sacred spaces in the world and behave accordingly.

Photography of the exterior of buildings is permitted. Do not photograph worshippers without permission.

## Church of the Holy Sepulchre

The church is shared by six Christian denominations under a complex status quo arrangement. Each community controls specific areas, and navigating the internal geography requires awareness.

The Stone of Anointing (inside the entrance) is where pilgrims kneel and touch the stone with their hands or with cloths and objects. There is often a queue — wait your turn. The Edicule (the structure housing Christ's tomb) has a longer queue — 30-60 minutes at peak times. Silence is expected inside.

Photography is permitted in most areas but flash photography is not. Do not take photographs during services. The Ethiopian monks on the roof of the church are particularly sensitive to photography.

Early morning (5:00am when the doors open) offers the most contemplative experience with the fewest visitors.

## Shabbat

From Friday sunset to Saturday sunset, Jewish Jerusalem observes Shabbat. Public transport stops. Most Jewish-area shops and restaurants close. The Western Wall becomes especially crowded on Friday evening as families gather.

Non-Jewish visitors should be aware that driving, smoking, and using phones near religious neighborhoods on Shabbat can cause offense. The Old City's Muslim and Christian quarters are less affected.

## General Principles

Do not enter any sacred space eating, drinking, or chewing gum. Turn off phone ringtones. Speak quietly. Ask before photographing people. If you are unsure whether you are welcome somewhere, ask — Jerusalem's residents are generally direct and helpful.
