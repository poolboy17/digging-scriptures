Rome's churches are open to visitors but they are not museums — they are active places of worship where Mass is celebrated daily and people come to pray. The etiquette is simpler than in multi-faith Jerusalem but equally important. Getting it right means you can enter freely; getting it wrong means being turned away at the door.

## Dress Code

Every church in Rome enforces a dress code: shoulders covered, knees covered. This applies to everyone — men and women alike. St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museums, and the major basilicas have guards who will turn you away.

Carry a scarf or light shawl to drape over bare shoulders. Avoid shorts in summer — lightweight trousers or a long skirt work at every site. Some churches provide paper coverings at the entrance, but this is inconsistent.

The dress code applies to the Vatican Museums as well, even though they are technically a museum rather than a church. The Sistine Chapel (inside the Museums) enforces silence — guards actively shush visitors.

## Photography

Photography rules vary by church. Most churches allow photography without flash. The Sistine Chapel prohibits all photography and video — guards enforce this. Santa Maria del Popolo, San Luigi dei Francesi (with the Caravaggio paintings), and several other art-significant churches prohibit photography of specific works.

During Mass or other services, put your camera away entirely. This is non-negotiable.

## Behavior in Churches

Enter quietly. Dip your fingers in the holy water font at the entrance and make the sign of the cross if you are Catholic; otherwise simply enter respectfully. Do not walk in front of the altar during services. Sit in pews quietly if you want to rest.

Conversations should be whispered. Phone calls should be taken outside. Groups should keep their voices down — many churches have signs requesting silence in multiple languages.

Tipping or donations: most churches have a donation box near the entrance. A small contribution (€1-2) is appreciated but not required. Candle lighting typically costs €0.50-1.

## The Vatican

St. Peter's Basilica is free to enter. The Vatican Museums require timed tickets — book online weeks ahead to avoid the multi-hour queue. Wednesday mornings, the Pope holds a public audience in St. Peter's Square (free tickets available through the Prefecture of the Papal Household).

The Vatican has its own rules as a sovereign state. Security screening at St. Peter's is airport-style. Large bags, umbrellas, and sharp objects are prohibited. The crypt beneath St. Peter's (the Vatican Grottoes) is free and accessed from inside the basilica.

The Scavi (excavations beneath the basilica, showing St. Peter's tomb) requires a separate booking through the Vatican Excavations Office — often months ahead.

## Mass and Services

Attending Mass as a visitor is welcome at all Roman churches. Sit, stand, and kneel with the congregation. You do not need to take communion if you are not Catholic. The service is in Italian at most parish churches and in Latin at some basilicas.
