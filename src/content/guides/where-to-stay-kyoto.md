Accommodation in sacred Japan is itself a pilgrimage experience. Sleeping in a Buddhist temple on Mount Kōya, eating shōjin ryōri vegetarian cuisine prepared by monks, soaking in a UNESCO-listed hot spring after a day on the Kumano Kodō — these are not just places to rest but integral parts of the spiritual journey.

This guide covers the three zones of our [7-day itinerary](/cities/kyoto/7-days-in-sacred-japan): Kyoto, Mount Kōya, and the Kumano Kodō trail. For JR Pass logistics, seasonal advice, and cultural etiquette, see our [planning guide](/cities/kyoto/planning-your-sacred-japan-trip).

## Kyoto: Choosing Your Base

Kyoto's sacred sites fan out from the city center in every direction. The best base depends on which temples are your priority and how you prefer to move.

**Downtown / Kawaramachi area** is the most practical base. Central, well-connected by bus and subway, close to Gion and the Higashiyama temple district. Hotels range from business hotels (¥8,000-12,000 / $55-80) to mid-range (¥15,000-25,000 / $100-170). The **Hotel Granvia Kyoto** sits above Kyoto Station itself — maximum convenience for JR connections.

**Higashiyama** puts you walking distance from Kiyomizu-dera, Gion, and the Philosopher's Path temples. Traditional ryokan (Japanese inns) concentrate here, offering tatami rooms, futon bedding, communal baths, and kaiseki multi-course dinners. Prices for ryokan start around ¥15,000 ($100) and reach ¥50,000+ ($340+) for high-end establishments. The experience — sleeping on tatami, bathing in an onsen, wearing a yukata robe — is worth experiencing at least one night.

**Near Fushimi Inari** (south Kyoto) suits pilgrims who want to walk the torii gate trail at dawn before the crowds. Several budget options and guesthouses cluster near the station.

**Arashiyama** (west Kyoto) is quieter and more rural. The bamboo grove and Tenryū-ji temple are walking distance, but reaching east Kyoto temples requires 30-40 minutes by bus. Best for travelers who prioritize the western temples.

## Temple Lodging on Mount Kōya

Mount Kōya (Kōya-san) has over 50 temples offering **shukubō** — temple lodging. This is one of Japan's most distinctive accommodation experiences and an essential part of the Kōya-san pilgrimage.

**What to expect**: tatami-mat rooms with futon bedding, shared bathrooms, communal baths. Dinner and breakfast are **shōjin ryōri** — Buddhist vegetarian cuisine prepared without meat, fish, onion, or garlic. The multi-course meal, served on lacquered trays in your room, is exquisite. Morning prayers at 6:00am are optional but strongly recommended — sitting in a darkened hall while monks chant sutras in candlelight is among the most powerful spiritual experiences in Japan.

**Prices** typically range from ¥10,000-15,000 ($70-100) per person including dinner and breakfast. Some high-end temples charge ¥20,000+ ($140+) for rooms with private gardens.

**Top temples for lodging**: **Eko-in** is the most popular with international visitors — English-speaking staff, fire ceremony (goma) demonstrations, and a meditation session. Book 2-3 months ahead. **Rengejo-in** offers beautifully painted fusuma (sliding door) rooms. **Fudoin** is smaller and quieter.

Book through the **Kōya-san Shukubō Association** website (in English) or through the Kōya-san Tourist Association. Peak seasons (autumn foliage in November, New Year, Obon in August) fill months ahead.

## Kumano Kodō Trail: Guesthouses and Minshuku

The [Nakahechi route](/cities/kyoto/walking-guide-kumano-kodo-nakahechi) passes through small mountain villages with limited accommodation. Lodging must be booked in advance — there is no walk-in availability on most of the trail.

**Accommodation types**: **Minshuku** (family-run guesthouses) are the standard. They offer tatami rooms, home-cooked dinner and breakfast (usually included in the price), and a communal bath. Hosts are typically elderly couples who have been welcoming pilgrims for decades. The personal warmth is genuine. Prices run ¥7,000-10,000 ($50-70) per person with two meals.

**Key stops along the Nakahechi**:

**Takahara** (end of Stage 1): One or two guesthouses in this tiny ridge-top village. **Kiri-no-Sato Takahara** is the established option. Book through Kumano Travel.

**Chikatsuyu** (end of Stage 2): Several minshuku options. **Minshuku Chikatsuyu** is reliable. A communal hot spring bath is available.

**Nonaka** (optional split of Stage 3): Very limited options — one or two guesthouses. Book early if splitting the longest day here.

**Yunomine Onsen** (after Kumano Hongū Taisha): This hot spring village is the traditional reward after reaching Hongū shrine. The **Tsuboyu** bathhouse is a UNESCO-listed natural hot spring — tiny, intimate, and available by reservation for private 30-minute sessions. Several ryokan and minshuku in the village offer onsen access. **Minshuku Deyashiki** and **Ryokan Yoshino-ya** are well-regarded.

**Kii-Katsuura** (after Nachi Falls): A coastal fishing town with hotels and ryokan. The **Hotel Urashima** is famous for its cave onsen — a natural hot spring inside a sea cave, reached by boat from the harbor. An extraordinary way to end the trail.

## Booking Logistics

The **Tanabe City Kumano Tourism Bureau** is the single best resource for Kumano Kodō accommodation. Their English-language website allows booking of guesthouses along the route, luggage forwarding between stops, and bus schedules. Contact them 2-4 weeks before your walk.

For Kyoto, booking platforms like Booking.com and Japanican work well. For ryokan specifically, **Japanese Guest Houses** (japaneseguesthouses.com) specializes in traditional accommodation.

**Luggage forwarding** (takkyūbin) is essential for the Kumano Kodō. Send your main bag ahead to your next night's accommodation for approximately ¥2,000 ($14) per bag. Walk with only a daypack. The tourism bureau arranges this.

## Practical Notes

**Shoes off**: always remove shoes when entering ryokan, minshuku, and temple lodging. Slippers are provided for indoor use; separate slippers for bathrooms.

**Bathing etiquette**: wash thoroughly at the shower station before entering the communal bath (onsen). Never put soap in the bath water. Towels stay outside the bath. Tattoos may be an issue at some public onsen — ask before booking.

**Meals**: dinner at minshuku and temple lodgings is typically served at a set time (6:00-7:00pm). Breakfast is early (7:00-8:00am). Inform your host of dietary restrictions when booking — accommodation is possible but not guaranteed in remote areas.
