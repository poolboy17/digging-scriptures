Seven days is the minimum to experience Japan's three-tiered sacred landscape: the refined temple culture of Kyoto, the mountain monasticism of [Mount Kōya](/places/mount-koya), and the ancient forest pilgrimage of the [Kumano Kodō](/routes/kumano-kodo). This itinerary moves from city to mountaintop to forest trail, each transition stripping away another layer of modern life until you are walking stone paths through primeval cedar groves, sleeping in village guesthouses, and eating meals prepared by people whose families have hosted pilgrims for centuries.

Read the [practical planning guide](/cities/kyoto/planning-your-sacred-japan-trip) for JR Pass details, temple lodging booking, luggage forwarding, and cultural etiquette.

## Day 1: Kyoto — Eastern Temples

**Morning — Fushimi Inari Shrine**

Start early. Fushimi Inari, with its thousands of vermillion torii gates climbing the mountainside, is one of the most visited sites in Japan. Before 8am, the lower paths are manageable and the upper trails are nearly empty. The full circuit to the summit takes 2-3 hours. Even a 45-minute walk up the lower tunnels of gates provides the signature experience. The light filtering through the torii creates an otherworldly atmosphere that photographs cannot capture.

**Late Morning — Kiyomizu-dera**

The eastern hillside temple compound offers sweeping views of Kyoto from its wooden terrace, built without a single nail. The approach through Higashiyama's pottery-lined streets is itself a journey through traditional craft culture. The Otowa waterfall beneath the main hall offers three streams — visitors drink from one using long-handled cups for health, longevity, or success in studies.

**Afternoon — Philosopher's Path and Nanzen-ji**

Walk the canal-side Philosopher's Path from Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion) south to Nanzen-ji. The 2-kilometer path is named for the Kyoto philosopher Nishida Kitaro, who walked it daily in meditation. Cherry trees line the canal. Small temples and tea houses punctuate the route. Nanzen-ji's massive san-mon gate and the Roman-style aqueduct running through its grounds are unexpected and beautiful.

**Evening — Gion District**

Walk through the geisha district at dusk. The wooden machiya townhouses, the lantern-lit tea houses, and the occasional glimpse of a maiko (apprentice geisha) in full dress provide a living connection to Kyoto's aesthetic traditions — the same traditions that shaped Japanese pilgrimage culture.

## Day 2: Kyoto — Western Temples and Zen

**Morning — Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Tenryu-ji**

The bamboo grove is magnificent before 8am, when the light is green and the crowds have not arrived. Adjacent Tenryu-ji, a UNESCO World Heritage Zen temple, has one of Kyoto's finest gardens — a fourteenth-century composition of pond, rocks, and borrowed mountain scenery that demonstrates the Japanese principle of framing nature as sacred art.

**Late Morning — Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)**

The gold-leafed pavilion reflected in its mirror pond is Kyoto's most iconic image. Visit mid-morning after the earliest rush subsides but before the afternoon peak. The garden surrounding the pavilion is designed as a walking meditation — each turn reveals a new composition.

**Afternoon — Ryoan-ji Rock Garden**

The most famous Zen garden in the world: fifteen rocks arranged on a bed of raked white gravel, surrounded by an earthen wall stained with age. Sit on the wooden veranda. The garden is designed so that from any position, at least one stone is hidden from view — a metaphor for the impossibility of perceiving the whole of reality from any single perspective. Allow time here. This is not a photograph opportunity. It is a practice.

**Evening — Prepare for Kōya-san**

Pack a small overnight bag for the mountain. Your main luggage can remain at your Kyoto hotel (most will store bags for free). Tomorrow's journey requires only clothing for one night, toiletries, and layers for cool mountain temperatures.

## Day 3: Mount Kōya — The Mountain Monastery

**Morning — Train to Kōya-san**

Take the JR train from Kyoto to Osaka (30 minutes), then the Nankai Railway from Namba Station to Gokurakubashi (90 minutes), then the cable car to the summit (5 minutes). The journey from Kyoto takes approximately 3-4 hours including transfers. The cable car ascent through forest — steep, dramatic, emerging into a high mountain plateau — physically enacts the transition from secular world to sacred space.

**Afternoon — Kōya-san Temple Complex**

Check into your shukubō (temple lodging). Explore the central temple complex: Kongōbu-ji (the head temple of Shingon Buddhism), Danjō Garan (the sacred precinct with its distinctive red pagoda), and the surrounding monastery buildings. [Kōbō Daishi](/stories/kobo-daishi-shikoku) founded this mountain settlement in 816 CE. Over a hundred temples still operate here.

**Evening — Okunoin Cemetery**

Walk the 2-kilometer path through Okunoin, the largest cemetery in Japan, to [Kōbō Daishi's](/stories/kobo-daishi-shikoku) mausoleum. Over 200,000 memorial stones line the path beneath towering cedars. The founder is believed to rest in eternal meditation, awaiting the future Buddha. Monks deliver meals to his tomb daily. At night, lanterns illuminate the path and the cemetery transforms entirely — the stones seem to breathe in the moving light.

**Shukubō Experience**

Return to your temple for dinner: shōjin ryōri, Buddhist vegetarian cuisine prepared as multi-course kaiseki. Sleep on futons on tatami floors. Set an alarm for the 6am morning prayer service. The chanting, the incense, the pre-dawn darkness of the prayer hall — this is the spiritual heart of the Kōya-san experience.

## Day 4: Kōya-san to Kumano — Begin the Trek

**6:00am — Morning Prayers**

Attend the morning service at your temple. The monks chant in a low drone. Candles and incense fill the hall. This is the same practice that has been performed here for twelve centuries.

**8:00am — Travel to Kumano Region**

Take the cable car and train from Kōya-san back to the coast. Travel to Kii-Tanabe by JR train (covered by JR Pass). From Kii-Tanabe, take the local bus to Takijiri, the official starting point of the Kumano Kodō's Nakahechi route. Arrange luggage forwarding through the Tanabe City Tourism Bureau before departure — your main bag will arrive at tonight's guesthouse.

**Afternoon — Takijiri to Takahara**

Begin walking. The first section climbs steeply from the riverside trailhead through dense forest to the mountain village of Takahara. Distance: approximately 4 kilometers. Walking time: 2-3 hours. The trail is well-marked and stone-paved in sections. The forest closes around you. Traffic noise disappears. Within 30 minutes, the only sounds are birds, your footsteps, and your breathing.

Takahara sits on a ridge with views across the valley to the mountains beyond. The village has a handful of guesthouses. Dinner is home-cooked Japanese comfort food. You sleep in a traditional room with futon on tatami. This is rural Japan at its most welcoming.

## Day 5: Kumano Kodō — Deep Forest

**7:00am — Takahara to Chikatsuyu**

The day's walk is the longest section: approximately 14 kilometers over mountain passes through primeval forest. Walking time: 6-7 hours. The trail passes through some of the most spectacular scenery on the entire Kumano Kodō — moss-covered stone paths, ancient trees, small wayside shrines marking the oji (subsidiary sacred sites) that punctuate the route.

Carry a packed lunch from your guesthouse (arranged the night before) and plenty of water. Rest at the teahouses that appear at intervals along the trail. The rhythm of the walk settles by midday — the meditative quality that the [psychology of pilgrimage](/context/psychology-of-pilgrimage) describes begins to establish itself.

Arrive in Chikatsuyu by mid-afternoon. The village hot spring onsen is the reward — soak away the trail fatigue in mineral-rich water.

## Day 6: Kumano Kodō — Arrival at Hongu

**7:00am — Chikatsuyu to Kumano Hongu Taisha**

The final section to the grand shrine: approximately 13 kilometers. Walking time: 5-6 hours. The trail passes through increasingly sacred landscape — more oji, more ancient trees, the forest growing denser and more atmospheric. The descent to Hongu is one of the great moments on the trail. You emerge from the forest and the massive torii gate of Kumano Hongu Taisha appears below.

**Afternoon — Kumano Hongu Taisha**

The first of the three Grand Shrines of Kumano. Pray at the shrine. Get your Kumano Kodō stamp booklet stamped here — this stamp, combined with your trailhead stamp, qualifies you for the Dual Pilgrim certificate if you have also completed the [Camino de Santiago](/cities/santiago-de-compostela).

**Evening — Yunomine Onsen**

Take the bus (30 minutes) to Yunomine Onsen, one of Japan's oldest hot spring villages. The Tsuboyu bathhouse — a UNESCO World Heritage hot spring, the only one in the world — is a tiny stone tub in a riverside hut. Bathing in the same mineral water that Kumano pilgrims have used for a thousand years is the fitting culmination of the walking pilgrimage.

## Day 7: Return to Kyoto

**Morning — Nachi Falls (Optional Extension)**

If time allows, take the bus from Hongu to Nachi (2 hours) to visit Kumano Nachi Taisha and Japan's tallest single-drop waterfall (133 meters). The Daimon-zaka approach — a stone staircase through towering cedars — is a short but spectacular final walk.

**Afternoon — Return to Kyoto**

Take the JR train from Kii-Katsuura or Shingū back to Kyoto (4-5 hours with connections). The journey retraces the transition from sacred mountain landscape to modern city, giving time to process the week's experiences.

**Evening — Final Night in Kyoto**

Return to the city with changed eyes. The temple gardens and shrine rituals now connect to the forest trails and mountain monasteries you have walked through. The aesthetic harmony of Kyoto's sacred spaces makes a different kind of sense after experiencing the raw spiritual landscape from which Japanese Buddhism emerged.

## Connecting to the Wider Pilgrimage

This itinerary covers two of the three major Japanese pilgrimage circuits. The [Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage](/routes/shikoku-88-temples) — a 1,200-kilometer circular walk around Japan's smallest main island — is the natural next journey for pilgrims who complete the Kumano Kodō and want to go deeper. The connection between Japan's pilgrimage tradition and the broader [Buddhist sacred sites](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism) in India traces a transmission that spans two thousand years.

The week-long format mirrors the experience of walking the last 100 kilometers of the Camino Francés — long enough to establish the meditative rhythm of sustained walking, short enough to fit within most people's available time. Both traditions teach the same lesson: the sacred is not a destination. It is a quality of attention developed through the physical act of walking.
