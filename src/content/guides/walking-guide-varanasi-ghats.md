The ghats of [Varanasi](/places/varanasi) form a continuous stone staircase along a 7-kilometer crescent of the Ganges. Eighty-four ghats descend from the dense lanes of the old city to the river's edge, each with its own history, character, and function. Some are bustling with bathers and priests at dawn. Others are quiet, crumbling, and visited only by stray dogs and meditating sadhus. Two are cremation ghats where funeral pyres burn around the clock.

Walking the ghats is free, requires no guide, and is the single best way to understand Varanasi. This guide covers the essential stretch from south to north — the 12 ghats that matter most — with practical details on timing, etiquette, and what you are seeing at each. For visa, health, and logistics, see our [Varanasi planning guide](/cities/varanasi/planning-your-varanasi-pilgrimage).

## The Walk at a Glance

**Route**: Assi Ghat (south) to Adi Keshava Ghat (north).
**Essential stretch**: Assi to Manikarnika — approximately 3 kilometers, 90 minutes without stops.
**Full walk**: Assi to Adi Keshava — approximately 5 kilometers, 2.5-3 hours.
**Best time**: dawn (5:00-8:00am) for bathing rituals and morning light, or late afternoon (4:00-6:00pm) leading into the evening Ganga Aarti.
**Terrain**: uneven stone steps, sometimes slippery. Sturdy shoes with grip.

The ghats are numbered but not in an intuitive sequence. Navigate by name rather than number.

## Southern Ghats: Assi to Dashashwamedh

### Assi Ghat

**Start here**. Assi Ghat is the southernmost major ghat and the natural starting point. It is one of the most popular ghats for visitors — wide stone steps, a large shiva lingam under a peepul tree at the water's edge, and a relaxed morning atmosphere. Locals practice yoga on the upper steps. Small boats depart from here for dawn rides.

A smaller, more intimate **evening aarti** takes place at Assi Ghat each night — less theatrical than the famous Dashashwamedh ceremony but more contemplative. Many pilgrims prefer it.

### Tulsi Ghat

Named after the sixteenth-century poet-saint Tulsidas, who wrote the Hindi Ramcharitmanas here. In its current state, the ghat has partially collapsed and sits in disrepair, but it retains historical significance. The annual Deva Deepawali festival illuminates this ghat with thousands of oil lamps.

### Hanuman Ghat and Shivala Ghat

Hanuman Ghat is associated with the saint Vallabhacharya, founder of the Pushti Marg devotional tradition. Shivala Ghat features a nineteenth-century palace built by the Maharaja of Varanasi — now partially restored, its ornate balconies overlook the river.

### Dashashwamedh Ghat

The most important ghat and the spiritual center of the riverfront. Its name means "ten-horse sacrifice" — referring to a Vedic ritual performed here by the god Brahma. This is where the famous **Ganga Aarti** takes place every evening.

The ghat is broad and busy at all hours. In the morning, Hindu priests offer riverbank prayer services (puja) to pilgrims. Flower sellers, boat operators, and sadhus compete for attention. The energy is intense and can be overwhelming for first-time visitors. Move through steadily and find a spot on the upper steps to observe before descending.

The **Ganga Aarti** begins at approximately 6:00pm in winter, 6:30pm in summer, and lasts 45 minutes. Seven priests perform synchronized fire rituals with tiered brass lamps. Arrive 45-60 minutes early for a seat on the steps. Our [3-day itinerary](/cities/varanasi/3-days-in-varanasi) organizes your first aarti experience into the flow of a full day.

## Central Ghats: Man Mandir to Lalita

### Man Mandir Ghat

A stunning ghat built by Maharaja Man Singh of Amber in 1600. The palace above the ghat features an eighteenth-century observatory (Jantar Mantar) with stone astronomical instruments similar to those in Jaipur and Delhi. The carved stone balconies and windows of the palace are among the finest architectural details on the riverfront.

### Lalita Ghat

Home to the **Nepali Temple** — a carved wooden pagoda that looks transplanted from Kathmandu, because it was. Built by the King of Nepal, it is the only Nepali-style temple in Varanasi and features explicit erotic carvings modeled on those at Pashupatinath in Kathmandu.

## The Cremation Ghats

### Harishchandra Ghat

The older and smaller of Varanasi's two cremation ghats. Named after the mythological king Harishchandra, who worked here as a cremation attendant as part of his test of truth. It is less visited by tourists than Manikarnika and consequently has a more intimate, less pressured atmosphere. You can observe from the upper steps. Photography is prohibited.

### Manikarnika Ghat

The primary cremation ghat and the most sacred site on the entire riverfront. Hindu tradition holds that dying in Varanasi and being cremated at Manikarnika grants moksha — liberation from the cycle of rebirth. The fires here have burned continuously for thousands of years, according to tradition.

What you see: bodies wrapped in white cloth are carried down the steps on bamboo stretchers. They are immersed briefly in the Ganges, then placed on stacked wood pyres. The eldest son lights the pyre. The fire burns for approximately three hours. Multiple cremations happen simultaneously.

**Etiquette is critical here**:

Do not photograph the cremation ceremonies. This is strictly enforced and deeply offensive to families present. Do not approach the pyres closely. Observe from the upper steps or from a boat at a respectful distance on the river.

Self-appointed "guides" near Manikarnika may approach offering to explain the rituals and then request money for "wood donations." Most are not affiliated with the cremation services. Politely decline. If you want to understand what you are witnessing, hire a registered guide from a reputable agency before visiting.

The theology behind Manikarnika transforms what could be disturbing into something profound. This is not a hidden process — death in Varanasi is public, communal, and sacred. The families present are not mourning in the way Western visitors might expect. They are performing a final act of devotion — releasing a soul from the cycle of rebirth at the one place on earth where that release is guaranteed.

## Northern Ghats: Scindia to Panchganga

### Scindia Ghat

Dramatically tilted and partially submerged. The Scindia Ghat temple — leaning at a sharp angle, half-swallowed by the river — is one of Varanasi's most photographed sites. The subsidence occurred when the ghat's weight exceeded the riverbank's capacity. The tilting temple has become a symbol of the river's power to reshape even sacred architecture.

### Panchganga Ghat

The northernmost ghat of major significance, where five sacred rivers are believed to converge with the Ganges (though only the Ganges is physically visible). The large Alamgir Mosque at the top of the ghat — built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the site of a demolished Vishnu temple — stands as a reminder of Varanasi's layered and sometimes contested history.

From Panchganga, you can continue north to Adi Keshava Ghat (another 2 kilometers, increasingly quiet), or return south along the ghats at a different time of day to experience how the same stones change character between dawn and dusk.

## Practical Notes

The ghats are open 24 hours. The stone steps are uneven and can be slippery when wet — especially near the water's edge where algae accumulates. Sturdy shoes with grip are essential. Sandals are risky.

Carry water and sunscreen. Shade is limited on the open steps. In summer, the stone absorbs heat and can be uncomfortable to sit on by midday.

Dogs are everywhere on the ghats. They are generally docile but avoid disturbing sleeping dogs on the steps.

Touts and boat operators will approach frequently, especially at Dashashwamedh and Manikarnika. A firm but polite "no" or simply not engaging works best.
