No city on earth has drawn more pilgrims across more centuries than Jerusalem. For Jews it is the site of the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence, the city toward which every prayer is directed. For Christians it is where Jesus was crucified, buried, and resurrected. For Muslims it is al-Quds, the holy, the place from which the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.

These competing claims have made Jerusalem simultaneously the most sacred and most contested city in human history. The [Western Wall](/places/western-wall) and the [Dome of the Rock](/places/dome-of-the-rock) share the same hilltop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre sits a few hundred meters from [Al-Aqsa Mosque](/places/al-aqsa-mosque). Pilgrims from three faiths walk the same narrow streets of the [Old City](/places/jerusalem-old-city), often to sites that are sacred for entirely different reasons.

## Jewish Pilgrimage to Jerusalem

The Jewish connection to Jerusalem is the oldest, rooted in the biblical command to appear before God at the Temple three times a year. These [three pilgrim festivals](/context/three-pilgrim-festivals-judaism) — Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot — brought the entire nation to Jerusalem in a practice known as [aliyah leregel](/context/aliyah-leregel), ascending on foot. The [Temple Mount ascent](/routes/temple-mount-ascent) was the culmination of a journey that could take days or weeks.

After the Temple's destruction in 70 CE, Jewish pilgrimage became an act of mourning and longing. The Western Wall became the focus of devotion. Sites outside Jerusalem like [Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs](/places/hebron-cave-patriarchs) and [Rachel's Tomb](/places/rachels-tomb) near Bethlehem became secondary pilgrimage destinations that kept the geographic connection alive through centuries of exile.

## Christian Pilgrimage to Jerusalem

Christian pilgrimage began in the fourth century after [Helena](/stories/helena-and-the-true-cross), mother of Emperor Constantine, traveled to the Holy Land and identified the sites of Jesus's crucifixion and burial. [Egeria](/stories/egeria-first-pilgrim-writer), writing a few decades later, left the earliest detailed account of a Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem, describing the liturgical celebrations at each holy site with remarkable vividness.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre became the single most important destination in Christendom. The Via Dolorosa became the template for Stations of the Cross replicated in churches worldwide. Jerusalem shaped Christian sacred geography so profoundly that medieval maps placed it at the center of the world.

## Islamic Pilgrimage to Jerusalem

Jerusalem holds a unique place in Islamic tradition as the site of the Isra and Mi'raj — Muhammad's night journey from Mecca and his ascension through the heavens. The [Dome of the Rock](/places/dome-of-the-rock) marks the ascension point, and [Al-Aqsa](/places/al-aqsa-mosque) anchors the Haram al-Sharif. Jerusalem was the first qibla before Mecca.

While not part of the Hajj, Jerusalem is a major destination for [ziyarat](/context/ziyarat-visiting-shrines-islam). Pilgrims who visit Mecca and Medina often extend their journey to include al-Quds, completing a triangulation of Islam's three holiest cities.

## The City as Living Pilgrimage

What distinguishes [Jerusalem](/places/jerusalem) from other pilgrimage cities is its density. Within the Old City's one square kilometer, pilgrims encounter more sacred sites per step than anywhere else on earth. The city forces traditions into proximity, creating a landscape where sacred geography physically overlaps.

## Experiences and Tours

Guided tours and local experiences offer a deeper connection to the sacred sites and living traditions of this region.
