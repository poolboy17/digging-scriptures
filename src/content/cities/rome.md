Rome has been the center of Western Christianity for nearly two thousand years. Pilgrims began arriving before the faith was even legal, descending into catacombs to pray at the tombs of Peter and Paul. By the medieval period, Rome had become one of the three great pilgrimage destinations of Christendom — alongside Jerusalem and Santiago de Compostela — drawing hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually along routes that crisscrossed Europe.

What makes [Rome](/places/rome-vatican) distinctive as a pilgrimage city is that it is not simply a place where sacred events occurred. It is a place that was deliberately constructed as a stage for Christian devotion. The basilicas, the relics, the processions, the papal audiences — all were designed to transform the act of visiting Rome into a spiritual experience that justified the weeks or months of travel required to reach it.

## The City of Peter and Paul

Rome's claim to Christian authority rests on a single assertion: that the apostle Peter came to Rome, led the early Christian community there, and was martyred and buried on the Vatican hill. St. Peter's Basilica — the largest church in Christendom — was built directly over his believed burial site. Archaeological excavations beneath the basilica in the twentieth century uncovered a shrine dating to roughly 160 CE, lending material evidence to a tradition that had shaped Western Christianity for centuries.

Paul, the other great apostle of Rome, was executed along the Via Ostiense and buried at the site now marked by the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls. These two tombs — Peter's and Paul's — were the original destinations for pilgrims to Rome, and they remain so today. The tradition of visiting both basilicas, along with the Basilica of St. Mary Major and the Basilica of St. John Lateran, formed the medieval practice of the "four major basilicas" that earned pilgrims a plenary indulgence.

## The Via Francigena: Europe's Road to Rome

For medieval pilgrims, the journey to Rome was itself a spiritual practice. The [Via Francigena](/routes/via-francigena) — the road from Canterbury to Rome — became the most important pilgrimage route in Western Europe after the Camino de Santiago. The earliest detailed account of the route comes from Sigeric the Serious, Archbishop of Canterbury, who recorded the seventy-nine stops on his return journey from Rome in 990 CE.

The Via Francigena passed through France, over the Alps at the Great St. Bernard Pass, and down through Tuscany to Rome. Pilgrims traveling from Scandinavia had their own route — [St. Olav's Way](/routes/st-olavs-way) led first to Trondheim and then could connect to the network of roads heading south toward Rome. The convergence of these routes meant that Rome was not just a destination but the hub of an entire European pilgrimage network.

## Relics and the Economy of Devotion

Rome became the greatest repository of [relics and sacred objects](/context/relics-and-sacred-objects) in the Christian world. The Scala Santa — the staircase Jesus is believed to have climbed during his trial before Pontius Pilate — was reportedly brought to Rome by [Helena](/stories/helena-and-the-true-cross) in the fourth century. Fragments of the True Cross, the chains that bound Peter, thorns from the crown of thorns — Rome accumulated sacred objects the way a capital accumulates political power.

This concentration of relics was not accidental. The papacy understood that relics drew pilgrims, and pilgrims brought revenue and prestige. The construction of grand basilicas to house these relics was simultaneously an act of devotion and an exercise in institutional authority. The [history of Christian pilgrimage](/context/history-of-christian-pilgrimage) cannot be separated from the history of Rome's deliberate cultivation of itself as the faith's geographic center.

The Holy Year tradition, instituted by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300, formalized Rome's status. During a Jubilee year, pilgrims who visited designated basilicas and fulfilled specific conditions received a plenary indulgence — full remission of the temporal punishment due for sins. The first Holy Year drew an estimated two million pilgrims, overwhelming the city's infrastructure and demonstrating the enormous pulling power of organized pilgrimage.

## Medieval Pilgrims in Rome

The experience of medieval pilgrims in Rome was often overwhelming and sometimes dangerous. The city was a fraction of its ancient size, with enormous ruins surrounded by villages and farmland. Pilgrims navigated a landscape where cattle grazed in the Roman Forum and the Colosseum served as a quarry for building materials.

[Margery Kempe](/stories/margery-kempe-medieval-pilgrim), the fifteenth-century English mystic, visited Rome as part of her wider pilgrimage that also took her to Jerusalem and Santiago. Her account reveals a city where sacred sites coexisted with filth, corruption, and danger — and where the spiritual rewards were considered worth every hardship.

The pilgrim guidebooks of the period — the Mirabilia Urbis Romae and its successors — provided itineraries that mapped the sacred geography of Rome onto a walking route. Pilgrims would visit the seven pilgrimage churches over two days, a practice that remains popular today. This structured approach to sacred tourism was remarkably modern in its concept, and it remains the template for how most visitors experience Rome's religious heritage.

## The Vatican Today

Modern Rome receives over fifteen million visitors annually, and the Vatican remains the beating heart of Catholic pilgrimage. St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums together form one of the most visited cultural complexes on earth. The papal audience — held every Wednesday when the Pope is in Rome — draws tens of thousands to St. Peter's Square.

But the pilgrimage experience in Rome extends far beyond the Vatican. The catacombs of San Callisto and San Sebastiano along the Appian Way offer a connection to the earliest Christian community. The Basilica of San Clemente, with its three layers of archaeological remains — a twelfth-century church atop a fourth-century church atop a first-century house — literally embodies Rome's accumulated sacredness.

For pilgrims approaching Rome on the Via Francigena, the first glimpse of St. Peter's dome from Monte Mario remains one of the great moments in European pilgrimage. The dome, designed by Michelangelo, was deliberately positioned to be visible from the northern approaches to the city — a beacon drawing pilgrims toward their destination just as the towers of Santiago's cathedral drew pilgrims at the end of the Camino.

## Beyond Rome: Lourdes and the European Network

Rome's influence extends to pilgrimage sites across Europe that fall under Catholic tradition. [Lourdes](/places/lourdes), in southern France, became one of the most visited pilgrimage destinations in the world after Bernadette Soubirous reported visions of the Virgin Mary in 1858. Though geographically distant from Rome, Lourdes operates within the institutional framework of Catholic pilgrimage that Rome established — its apparitions were verified by the Church, its miracles assessed by Vatican-appointed commissions.

Together, Rome and its network of affiliated shrines and routes represent the infrastructure of Catholic pilgrimage that has operated continuously since the age of Constantine. The stones may be ancient, but the institution built upon them remains very much alive.
