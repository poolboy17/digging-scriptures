Rome stands at the center of Christian pilgrimage not because of events in the life of Jesus — none of the Gospels connect him to Rome — but because of what happened after. The apostles Peter and Paul were both martyred here, and on the foundation of Peter's tomb the Roman church built the institution that would shape Christianity for two millennia. Every road led to Rome, and for medieval pilgrims, Rome was one of the three great destinations alongside Jerusalem and Santiago.

## The Vatican and St. Peter's

[Rome and the Vatican](/places/rome-vatican) together form the spiritual capital of Catholicism. St. Peter's Basilica, built over the apostle's burial site, is the largest church in the world. The Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums, and the papal audiences draw millions annually. For centuries, pilgrims traveled the [Via Francigena](/routes/via-francigena) from Canterbury to Rome, a journey of months that rivaled the Camino in ambition.

The city's pilgrimage infrastructure developed over centuries. The seven pilgrimage churches of Rome established a circuit that pilgrims walk to this day. The catacombs beneath the city preserve the earliest Christian art and burial practices.

## Relics and Sacred Objects

Rome houses an extraordinary concentration of [relics and sacred objects](/context/relics-and-sacred-objects) — fragments of the True Cross, the chains of St. Peter, the Scala Santa that Jesus is believed to have climbed. The medieval [history of Christian pilgrimage](/context/history-of-christian-pilgrimage) cannot be understood without understanding Rome's role as the central repository of sacred material culture.

## The Roads to Rome

The [Via Francigena](/routes/via-francigena) brought pilgrims from England and northern Europe through France and over the Alps. [St. Olav's Way](/routes/st-olavs-way) in Norway connected Scandinavia to the broader network. [Margery Kempe](/stories/margery-kempe-medieval-pilgrim) traveled to Rome in the fifteenth century and left a vivid account of the experience. [Helena](/stories/helena-and-the-true-cross) passed through on her way to the Holy Land.

Even [Lourdes](/places/lourdes), which emerged as a pilgrimage destination only in the nineteenth century, exists within Rome's gravitational field — Bernadette's visions required Vatican validation, and the shrine's status depends on papal authority.

## Rome Today

Modern pilgrims find a city that layers the ancient onto the contemporary. The Vatican Museums draw art lovers and believers alike. The catacombs offer an encounter with early Christianity that no textbook can replicate. The papal audience remains one of the world's great public spiritual experiences.
