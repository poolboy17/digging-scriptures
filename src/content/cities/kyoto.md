Japan's sacred geography is unlike anything in the Western pilgrimage traditions. Where Christianity and Islam center on specific historical events — a crucifixion, a revelation — Japanese pilgrimage weaves together Buddhist philosophy, Shinto nature worship, and a landscape theology in which mountains, forests, and rivers are themselves sacred.

## Mount Kōya and the Monastery Town

[Mount Kōya](/places/mount-koya) is the headquarters of Shingon Buddhism, founded by [Kōbō Daishi](/stories/kobo-daishi-shikoku) (Kūkai) in the ninth century. The mountaintop town of over a hundred temples offers overnight stays in temple lodgings where pilgrims eat Buddhist vegetarian cuisine, join morning prayers, and walk the vast Okunoin cemetery to Kōbō Daishi's mausoleum.

## The Kumano Kodō

The [Kumano Kodō](/routes/kumano-kodo) trails are a network of ancient pilgrimage routes through the mountains of the Kii Peninsula. Unlike the Camino's single-path model, the Kumano Kodō offers multiple routes converging on the three Grand Shrines of Kumano. The trails are a UNESCO World Heritage Site — one of only two pilgrimage routes to hold that distinction alongside the Camino.

## Shikoku's 88 Temples

The [Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage](/routes/shikoku-88-temples) is a 1,200-kilometer circuit around Japan's smallest main island, visiting temples associated with Kōbō Daishi. Pilgrims — called henro — walk in white robes, carrying staffs that represent the master walking beside them. The circuit takes 30-60 days on foot and is one of the few circular pilgrimages in the world.

## The Buddhist Path

Japan's pilgrimages connect to the broader tradition of [Buddhist sacred sites](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism) across Asia. [Xuanzang](/stories/xuanzang-buddhist-pilgrim), the seventh-century Chinese monk, undertook a sixteen-year journey to India that inspired Japanese Buddhist travelers for centuries. The [psychology of pilgrimage](/context/psychology-of-pilgrimage) — the way walking changes consciousness — finds perhaps its purest expression in the meditative rhythms of Japanese trail pilgrimage.
