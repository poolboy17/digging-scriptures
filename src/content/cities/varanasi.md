India contains more pilgrimage destinations per square kilometer than any country on earth. From the ghats of Varanasi to the Bodhi Tree at Bodh Gaya, the subcontinent is layered with sites sacred to Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The concept of tirtha — a crossing place where the divine and human worlds meet — shapes Indian sacred geography at every scale.

## Varanasi and the Ganges

[Varanasi](/places/varanasi) is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and the holiest city in Hinduism. Pilgrims come to bathe in the Ganges at the ghats, to perform rituals for the dead at Manikarnika Ghat, and to witness the evening Ganga Aarti ceremony. To die in Varanasi is believed to grant moksha — liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

## Bodh Gaya and the Bodhi Tree

[Bodh Gaya](/places/bodh-gaya) marks the spot where Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment beneath a pipal tree. The Mahabodhi Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, draws Buddhist pilgrims from across the world. It is the most sacred site in Buddhism — the place where the central event of the tradition occurred.

## Sarnath and the First Sermon

[Sarnath](/places/sarnath), just outside Varanasi, is where the newly awakened Buddha gave his first teaching — the Deer Park discourse that set the wheel of dharma in motion. Together with Bodh Gaya, Sarnath forms part of the [four sacred sites of Buddhism](/context/four-sacred-sites-buddhism).

## Lumbini and the Birth

[Lumbini](/places/lumbini), across the border in Nepal, is the birthplace of the Buddha. The sacred garden, marked by the Ashoka Pillar from the third century BCE, is the starting point of the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit that connects to Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar.

## The Greater Circuit

Beyond these core sites, the [kora around Mount Kailash](/routes/kora-mount-kailash) in Tibet represents one of the most demanding pilgrimages in the world — sacred to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Bön practitioners. [Xuanzang](/stories/xuanzang-buddhist-pilgrim) traveled through much of this territory in the seventh century, and his account remains a primary source for understanding early Buddhist geography. Understanding [what pilgrimage means](/context/what-is-pilgrimage) begins here, where the tradition is oldest and most layered.
