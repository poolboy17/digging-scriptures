Santiago de Compostela is the end of a road, and that road — the [Camino de Santiago](/routes/camino-de-santiago) — is the most walked pilgrimage route in the world. Over 400,000 pilgrims complete some version of the Camino each year, arriving at the cathedral where the apostle James is believed to be buried. The city exists because of pilgrimage, and pilgrimage in Europe would look different without the city.

## The Legend

The [Legend of Saint James](/stories/legend-of-saint-james) connects the apostle to Spain through a chain of tradition, miracle, and medieval politics. James is said to have preached in Iberia before returning to Jerusalem, where he was martyred. His body, according to tradition, was transported by stone boat back to Galicia. The discovery of the tomb in the ninth century created the pilgrimage.

## The Camino

The Camino de Santiago is not one route but many. The Camino Francés, the most popular, crosses northern Spain for 800 kilometers from the French border. The Camino Portugués comes up from Lisbon. The Camino del Norte follows the coast. Each route converges on [Santiago de Compostela](/places/santiago-de-compostela), where pilgrims attend the Pilgrim's Mass at the cathedral and receive the Compostela certificate.

The [Abraham Path](/routes/abraham-path) in the Middle East draws conscious inspiration from the Camino model — adapting pilgrimage-trail infrastructure for a different region and tradition.

## Why People Still Walk

The modern Camino has become a case study in [pilgrimage and tourism](/context/pilgrimage-tourism-modern-era). Walkers come for reasons that range from deep faith to fitness to grief recovery. The [psychology of pilgrimage](/context/psychology-of-pilgrimage) — the transformation that sustained walking produces — is visible in the conversations at every albergue along the way.

[Women](/context/women-and-pilgrimage) have walked the Camino since the medieval period. [Margery Kempe](/stories/margery-kempe-medieval-pilgrim) passed through Santiago in the fifteenth century. Today, women make up roughly half of all Camino walkers.

## The City

Santiago itself is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cathedral, with its Baroque façade and Romanesque interior, dominates the old quarter. The Praza do Obradoiro, where pilgrims traditionally weep upon arriving, is one of Europe's great public squares.
