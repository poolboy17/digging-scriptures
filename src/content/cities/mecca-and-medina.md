[Mecca](/places/mecca) and [Medina](/places/medina) together form the axis of Islamic pilgrimage. Every Muslim who is physically and financially able is obligated to perform the [Hajj](/routes/hajj-route) at least once. It is the [fifth pillar of Islam](/context/five-pillars-hajj-explained), so central that it shapes the religious calendar, mosque architecture worldwide, and the spiritual aspirations of nearly two billion people.

## Mecca and the Hajj

The Hajj rituals reenact events from the lives of Ibrahim, Hajar, and Ismail. Pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times, walk between Safa and Marwa, and stand on the plain of Arafat in collective supplication. Over two million pilgrims converge on Mecca during the designated days of Dhul Hijjah — the largest annual gathering of human beings on earth.

The [Umrah](/routes/umrah), the lesser pilgrimage, can be performed at any time of year. Millions perform Umrah annually, especially during Ramadan.

## Medina and the Prophet's Mosque

Medina holds a different kind of holiness. The Prophet's Mosque, built around Muhammad's burial place, is the second holiest site in Islam. To pray there is considered worth a thousand prayers elsewhere. The city offers a gentler spiritual experience than Mecca's intensity — pilgrims visit the Prophet's grave, pray in the original courtyard, and walk the streets where early Islam took shape.

## Beyond the Two Holy Cities

Islamic sacred geography extends through the tradition of [ziyarat](/context/ziyarat-visiting-shrines-islam) — visiting shrines, tombs, and holy places. For Shia Muslims, [Najaf and Karbala](/places/najaf-karbala) in Iraq hold significance that rivals Mecca itself.

[Ibn Battuta](/stories/ibn-battuta-pilgrim-traveler), the fourteenth-century Moroccan scholar, began his legendary journey as a Hajj pilgrim. His account shows how the Hajj functioned not merely as religious obligation but as a gateway to a wider world of Islamic learning and cultural exchange.
