Ramadan — the Islamic month of fasting, prayer, and spiritual reflection — transforms the pilgrimage landscape across the Muslim world. Mosques fill beyond capacity for tarawih (evening prayers). Sacred cities take on a rhythm defined by the fast: quiet, contemplative days followed by festive, communal evenings. For pilgrims, Ramadan adds a layer of spiritual intensity to visits that is unavailable at any other time of year.

## Umrah During Ramadan

Performing [Umrah](/routes/umrah) during Ramadan carries special significance in Islamic tradition. The Prophet Muhammad stated that Umrah during Ramadan is equivalent in reward to performing Hajj. As a result, [Mecca and Medina](/cities/mecca-and-medina) during Ramadan are extraordinarily crowded — millions of Muslims travel specifically for this purpose.

The Grand Mosque extends its hours, with tarawih prayers lasting late into the night. The atmosphere during the last ten nights of Ramadan — when Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Power) is believed to occur — is the most intense spiritual experience the Islamic world offers. Hundreds of thousands pray through the night, many weeping openly.

Practical implications: accommodation prices in Mecca triple or quadruple. Book 3-6 months ahead. The crowds around the Kaaba during tarawih can be overwhelming. If performing Umrah during Ramadan, plan for longer waits and more physical demands. See our [planning guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/planning-your-hajj-or-umrah) and [etiquette guide](/cities/mecca-and-medina/etiquette-hajj).

## Jerusalem During Ramadan

[Jerusalem's](/cities/jerusalem) Old City takes on a distinctive character during Ramadan. The Muslim Quarter quiets during daylight hours — many shops and restaurants close. But after iftar (the evening meal breaking the fast), the quarter comes alive. Streets fill with families, food stalls appear, and the atmosphere becomes festive.

The [Al-Aqsa Mosque](/places/al-aqsa-mosque) and the [Dome of the Rock](/places/dome-of-the-rock) draw enormous crowds for Friday prayers during Ramadan, particularly on the last Friday (known as Jumat al-Wida). Access to the Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif for non-Muslim visitors may be restricted during this period — check current schedules.

For non-Muslim visitors, Ramadan in Jerusalem means adjusting expectations. Some restaurants in East Jerusalem and the Muslim Quarter close during daytime. The Christian and Jewish quarters are unaffected. The evening atmosphere in the Old City, with its mix of Ramadan celebrations and normal city life, is uniquely atmospheric.

## Etiquette for Non-Muslim Travelers

Whether you are Muslim or not, traveling in Muslim-majority areas during Ramadan requires awareness. Do not eat, drink, or smoke in public during daylight hours — this is both a legal requirement in some countries and a basic courtesy everywhere. Dress modestly. Be patient with reduced business hours and slower service.

Many hotels and restaurants in tourist areas continue to serve food during the day, but discretion is expected. Eating behind closed doors is fine; eating while walking through a market is not.

The positive side: Ramadan is a month of generosity and hospitality. Iftar meals are often shared freely. Mosques distribute food to all visitors. The warmth extended to strangers — including non-Muslim travelers — is genuine and memorable.

## Other Destinations During Ramadan

**Istanbul**: the Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque) and Hagia Sophia area are particularly atmospheric during Ramadan. Special illuminations (mahya) are strung between minarets, and the Sultanahmet square hosts evening food markets.

**Cairo**: the historic mosques of Islamic Cairo — Al-Azhar, Sultan Hassan, Ibn Tulun — fill with worshippers. The Khan el-Khalili bazaar extends its hours into the night.

**Fez and Marrakech**: Moroccan Ramadan traditions include elaborate iftar meals and late-night socializing. The medinas are quieter by day and livelier by night than at any other time.

## When Is Ramadan?

Ramadan follows the Islamic lunar calendar and moves approximately 10-11 days earlier each year relative to the Gregorian calendar. In 2026, Ramadan is expected to begin around February 18 and end around March 19. In 2027, it will shift to approximately February 8-March 9. Check precise dates closer to travel, as they depend on moon sighting.
