Easter is the most important date in the Christian pilgrimage calendar — the week when sacred sites come alive with processions, liturgies, and rituals that have been repeated for centuries. If you're planning to be somewhere meaningful for Holy Week 2026 (March 29 – April 5, Western calendar), here are the destinations worth considering and the practical realities of experiencing them.

## Jerusalem: The Original

Nothing compares to being in [Jerusalem](/cities/jerusalem) for Easter. The [Via Dolorosa](/cities/jerusalem/walking-guide-jerusalem-old-city) — the route Christ walked to crucifixion — is processed by thousands of pilgrims on Good Friday. The [Church of the Holy Sepulchre](/places/jerusalem-old-city) hosts the dramatic Holy Fire ceremony on Holy Saturday, when the Orthodox Patriarch enters the tomb and emerges with what is proclaimed to be miraculously kindled fire, passed from candle to candle through a packed church.

The practical challenge is real. Jerusalem during Easter is crowded to capacity. Hotels within the Old City walls are booked 4-6 months ahead. Access to the Holy Sepulchre on Good Friday and Holy Saturday requires arriving hours early or joining an organized group. The [etiquette guide](/cities/jerusalem/etiquette-jerusalem) covers dress codes and photography rules that tighten during Holy Week.

What makes it worth the difficulty: standing in the place where the events occurred, surrounded by pilgrims from every Christian tradition on earth, singing in dozens of languages. The emotion is collective and overwhelming.

## Rome: The Papal Easter

[Rome](/cities/rome) offers the institutional spectacle. The Pope presides over Holy Week at the Vatican — the Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square, the Chrism Mass, the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday, the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum on Good Friday (a tradition revived by the popes in the twentieth century), and the Easter Vigil in St. Peter's Basilica.

The Easter Sunday Mass draws 50,000-100,000 to St. Peter's Square for the Urbi et Orbi blessing. Tickets for the indoor liturgies are free but must be requested through the Prefecture of the Papal Household well in advance.

Beyond the Vatican, Rome's parish churches hold their own Holy Week services — often more intimate and moving than the grand papal events. The [seven pilgrimage churches](/cities/rome/walking-guide-rome-seven-churches) are especially atmospheric during this period.

## Seville: The Processions

Spain's Semana Santa (Holy Week) traditions are among the most dramatic in Christianity. Seville's celebrations involve over 60 brotherhoods (hermandades) processing through the streets from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, carrying enormous pasos (floats) bearing life-sized sculptures of Christ and the Virgin Mary.

The **Madrugá** — the early hours of Good Friday when six brotherhoods process simultaneously through the darkened streets — is the emotional peak. The silence of the crowds, broken only by the occasional spontaneous saeta (flamenco prayer sung from a balcony), creates an atmosphere unlike anything else in Christian worship.

## Lesser-Known Traditions

**Ethiopia**: Ethiopian Orthodox Easter (Fasika) follows the Julian calendar and usually falls one to two weeks after Western Easter. Celebrations at Lalibela's rock-hewn churches — with white-robed worshippers processing by candlelight through the ancient complexes — are among Christianity's most ancient continuous traditions.

**Philippines**: the reenactment culture in towns like San Fernando (Pampanga) includes actual crucifixions — volunteers being nailed to crosses on Good Friday. The practice is controversial within the Catholic Church but continues as a deeply rooted folk tradition.

**Greece**: Corfu's Easter includes the dramatic shattering of clay pots from balconies on Holy Saturday and one of the most atmospheric midnight Resurrection services in the Orthodox world.

## Planning Essentials

Book accommodation 3-6 months ahead for Jerusalem and Rome during Easter. Flights to these destinations spike in price 6-8 weeks before Holy Week. Check whether Western and Eastern Easter coincide — in years when they do, Jerusalem is doubly crowded but the ecumenical atmosphere is extraordinary.
