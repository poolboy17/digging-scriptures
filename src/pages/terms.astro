            <p>By accessing and using Digging Scriptures ("the site"), you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the site.</p>

            <h2>Nature of Content</h2>

            <p>Digging Scriptures publishes educational and informational content about pilgrimage traditions, sacred places, and faith-based travel across world religions. Our content is descriptive and historical in nature. It is not religious instruction, spiritual advice, or travel guidance.</p>

            <p>While we strive for accuracy, content on the site may contain errors, omissions, or information that has become outdated since publication. We make no warranties regarding the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of any content. Articles reflect the state of scholarly understanding at the time of writing and may not account for subsequent discoveries, policy changes, or evolving access conditions at the sites described.</p>

            <h2>Not Travel Advice</h2>

            <p>Descriptions of pilgrimage routes, sacred sites, and travel experiences are provided for educational purposes. They do not constitute travel advice. Conditions at religious and historical sites — including access restrictions, safety considerations, political situations, visa requirements, and infrastructure — change frequently and without notice. Visitors to any site described on Digging Scriptures should consult current travel advisories, local authorities, and professional travel resources before making plans.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

            <p>All original text content on Digging Scriptures is the property of the site's publisher and is protected by copyright. You may quote brief excerpts for the purpose of commentary, criticism, or scholarship, consistent with fair use principles. You may not reproduce, republish, or redistribute substantial portions of the site's content without prior written permission.</p>

            <p>Photographs on the site are sourced from Unsplash under the <a href="https://unsplash.com/license" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unsplash License</a>, which permits use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Credit to individual photographers is provided where available. If you wish to use any image from this site, we recommend downloading the original from Unsplash to ensure compliance with the license terms.</p>

            <h2>Respect for Religious Traditions</h2>

            <p>Digging Scriptures covers sacred sites and practices of multiple religious traditions. Our approach is descriptive and respectful. We present historical evidence, scholarly interpretation, and traditional narratives with equal care, and we distinguish between documented history and faith-based tradition where the distinction matters. We do not advocate for or against any religious position.</p>

            <p>We ask that readers engage with our content in the same spirit of respect. The sites and traditions described on this site are sacred to living communities of believers. Understanding their significance — whether or not one shares the faith — is part of the pilgrimage scholarship we aim to support.</p>

            <h2>External Links</h2>

            <p>The site may contain links to external websites for reference or further reading. We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or availability of any external sites. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site or its content.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <p>Digging Scriptures is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any loss, injury, or damage arising from the use of this site or reliance on its content. This includes, without limitation, any harm resulting from travel decisions made on the basis of information found on the site.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

            <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page indicates the most recent revision. Continued use of the site after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
