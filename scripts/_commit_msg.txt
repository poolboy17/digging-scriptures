Redesign all pages with card-based layout and visual hierarchy

Replace plain text lists with styled card grids featuring rounded borders,
hover effects, and proper visual sections. Add hero sections with accent
dividers, top border accent bar, and empty state cards. Desert Rose theme
now visible through surface backgrounds, borders, and interactive states.
